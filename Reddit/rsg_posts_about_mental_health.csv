12,Mental Health topic: The Art and Technique of Mindfulness,123,ra6zaw,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ra6zaw/mental_health_topic_the_art_and_technique_of/,13,"You might hear this word ""Mindfulness"" being thrown around outside. I am here to teach you what it's all about and an exercise that may help you in your daily life. 

**What is Mindfulness?**

Mindfulness is the basic ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on in our world. Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing, or to your state of mind through your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful.

**What is the technique used?**

In IMH, they taught us this specific technique which I feel that it is quite convenient and useful. You only need two things, a quiet place and yourself. A place quiet enough to be able to listen to your breathing.

* Step 1: Sit down

* Step 2: Straighten your back

* Step 3: Put hands and legs in natural position (if you are on the floor, cross legs and put your hands on your legs. If you are on a chair, relax your legs and put your hands on your legs)

* Step 4: Set a time limit (can be anywhere from 5 - 20 minutes)

* Step 5: Close your eyes and breathe

* Step 6: Focus on your breathing, preferably with deep inhale and exhale. If your mind starts to wander off and develop thoughts, divert attention back to your breath

*The main purpose is to be aware of your own breathing to the point where you can hear and feel your breathing.* It sounds ridiculous to tell people to breathe when we have been subconsciously doing it everyday but you wouldn't notice until you actually do so. It is also to slow down in fast-paced world so you are able to conserve more energy and relieve stress and make clearer decisions in your head. *It remind us that we are in control of our lives because well, breathing is what make us alive. =]*

I am not selling mindfulness as a ""this shit makes you live for 20 more years"". It is a form of a ritual and with Singapore being an incredibly face-paced world where we deal with tough and draining situations, I think it is a good habit to pick up considering it is quite simple and [it comes with benefits such as reducing stress, reducing symptoms of depression and enhancing performance](https://www.mindful.org/what-is-mindfulness/) 

I hope this exercise improve some aspects of your lives and I just wanted to share it. *Stay safe peeps*

>""In 2019, the police attended to an incident of attempted suicide involving the then 14-year-old. Following the incident, he was taken into custody for his safety and subsequently referred to IMH for assessment. He was then discharged.

Now about IMH.

IMH houses patients with various illnesses such as bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD and others. They put them in individual wards. Imagine you come into one of the wards for depression and at one corner you see a person tied up to a bed and another corner you see a guy screaming for his parents. **It's quite insane**


Thankfully, this 16-year-old boy (who was then 14 years old) don't have to go through all these because there is a special place for him, **Sunrise Wing**. Sunrise Wing is the only psychiatric ward that serves children which is a relief because the environment will be less tense. **Unfortunately, children are more emotionally sensitive than adults** so any presence of tension would be worse for the kids than the adults. The environment will be different but still not good.


There are different types of therapies and some are more useful than others but **it's up to the patients themselves to improve**. Once they do, they would start feeling better and they will be discharged. This is where the support comes in but more often than not, **it's not there.** Which is why [for 50% of patients recovered from depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320269#12-early-signs-of-a-depression-relapse), it relapses in their lifetime


People don't get mental illness from nowhere. There are always causes such as heredity, psychological trauma, neglect and environmental factors (such as a death of a loved one, divorce or dysfunctional family). In the case of a child, the parents are the ones providing the support but if the parents are not, **the support system already failed**. 


Children looked at parents as pillars in their lives and even more so for the one with mental illness. But if the pillars crumble, well shit. In the boy's case, ~~the parents are not even coming to court, they know that they have failed.~~ [See dueter's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/onvxrq/regarding_yesterdays_incident_mental_health/h5ukt0d/) 
During my stay, I have seen countless patients that stay in IMH for **over 10 years. That is berserk.** All of these cases are the parents abandoning them. One of them has forgotten what his own house looks like.


I actually think that the Asian culture is very toxic. In this age, grades are king, tuition are gold. You need to be the best at this and that. We need to move away from all these mindset and prioritise both physical health and mental health especially. And that is why mental health awareness is super important. Names such as [Beyond the Label](https://www.ncss.gov.sg/our-initiatives/beyond-the-label/about-the-campaign) (thanks u/Eurito1 for link) and SAMH are promoting mental health awareness.


It is also pretty baffling that people are going to push these aside and say ""Never gonna happen in my lifetime"". and put on a passive approach. Problem is that in the event that happens, **all hell breaks loose**. It is the same as if Singapore were to record 39 degress Celsius every day, then people would say ""oh no we need to reduce, reuse, recycle stop using aircon lolol"". **It is already too late**. If your family or your wife or your children have a big episode, it will be like hell pretty much


What I want everyone to dabao from this is 

* Do not belittle mental health

* Spread mental health awareness by joining or helping out in events like [Beyond the Label](https://www.ncss.gov.sg/our-initiatives/beyond-the-label/about-the-campaign) and SAMH.

* The simplest thing you can do to help is **just to check on people**, ask them how they are especially people you haven't heard back from in a long while and provide a listening ear. People like people caring about them.

* Direct people in need to professional help such as SOS (1800 221 4444), IMH Emergency Hotline (6389 2222), other hotlines such as addictions https://www.imh.com.sg/wellness/page.aspx?id=1245 , counsellors and a&e departments

If you are suffering from anxiety or mental problems, **TELL SOMEBODY**. No matter who you tell, it will be a lot better than **keeping it to yourself**.

Prevention is better than cure. Once everyone in the country have better awareness about mental health, the already lacking mental health infrastructure will improve and I wouldn't have to wait 2 weeks for my case manager to call me back

*We can prevent another horrific incident like this*

21,"Personal story regarding mental health and bullying, being denied an education, and my plea to fellow Singaporeans",862,oos89q,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oos89q/personal_story_regarding_mental_health_and/,104,"After reading about the RVHS incident, I felt powerless and depressed. My friends were worried — I always get affected by incidents like these. Especially so, when:

\- My friends' friend committed suicide 2 weeks ago.

\- Multiple teachers telling me that their students committed suicide during a recent dialogue.

\- Ashlee's case.

\- The girl who overdosed herself and penned a letter to PM Lee.

\- Last but not least... My case that went under the radar: bullied, misdiagnosed and denied an education.

The one thing that ties all of these cases together is the fact that mental health is a very real problem that is sadly going unnoticed in the larger MOE system.

Too many cases. Too little action. After much consideration, I decided to reveal my story here to show the harsh reality of cases that fall through the cracks of the system, i.e. outliers. **This is going to be a long post, so bear with me.**

**My story**

I attempted suicide in 2011. Why? Because I was bullied by my classmates for the way I looked and talked. Yes, you heard it right; you can get bullied for being too ugly. Some also did a cyberbullying campaign attacking me, **which my school dismissed as ""you're being too sensitive"" and ""how can you be so sure they are talking about you"".**

I slowly developed depression and what I eventually came to know was  social anxiety. I also had a severe phobia of school that led me to skip school most of the time. If I were to somehow attend school, I would actively avoid eating because I was afraid to be bullied by my peers. I will spare you guys the details, and instead highlight some things that were done to me - things that no school should ever do to their students. 

\- Once, out of desperation, I wrote a suicide essay for my exam in 2012. Rather than receiving help, **I was mocked by both teachers and students alike in public**. Part of my essay (regarding my suicide attempt) was read aloud in class and my classmates laughed at it.

\- My school maintained the stance that **mental health conditions did not exist** and that it was all in the mind, and I was **making life difficult for them**.

\- I had a panic attack that made me hurt myself publicly. **My teacher said that I was just an attention-seeker and ignored me**.

I eventually came to see the school as a prison. They did many, many things that hurt my mental state. There was no way out, especially with my traditional family believing that ""the school is always right"". Fast forward to 2014, my teachers used physical force to ""coax"" me into a room for some talk. (Yes. They actually used that word.) Seeing that they refused to let me see the school counselor, I called the police out of self-defense and begged them to save me. The school counselor blamed me for making matters worse, even though she did not help me at all throughout my journey. **On the other hand, the principal, who had always maintained that I was just a rebellious student and had no mental health condition, told the police that I was mentally unsound and they need not come down to the school.**

I was ultimately forced to sign a contract that essentially banned me from mentioning the incidents that happened in school, together with getting my handphone confiscated. As I refused to sign the contract, I was barred from entering the school and got locked up at home.

**Was there any support during my secondary school journey?**

Before I continue, I would like to mention I did try seeking help from different avenues. Anything I could think of, I tried. Teachers. Counselors. Social workers. Family Service Centre. IMH.

Thanks to my school's actions and the tunnel vision focus on the bad side effects from computer gaming back then, IMH purposefully diagnosed me with gaming addiction and said that I had no such thing as depression or social anxiety. I vividly remember this conversation with IMH’s psychiatrist to this day:

""So are you saying that I got bullied because of gaming addiction?""

""Yes."" 

""And gaming addiction led me to depression?"" 

""Yes.""

They even wanted to force me to take medication and/or be warded for gaming addiction. As a 14 year old, it did not make sense to me. *Was I going crazy? Was I the one at fault?* All these thoughts just flooded my head. That and their actions led to multiple panic attacks.

My school even managed to get IMH (REACH) to convince my family to use *Beyond Parental Control* on me just because of my failing grades. Social workers and counselors also ignored my feelings and only listened to my school and family. **The ""neutral classmates"" refused to help as they did not want the school to punish them.** I was essentially cornered with nobody to turn to, and I began to fall into despair. Life became meaningless for me.

TLDR, my situation became an outlier because I had **no support** at all. The safety net that was supposed to catch me **failed at every layer**. *If not for this thing called ""willpower"", I am not so sure if I would have survived my circumstances*. In visual novel terms, I am very susceptible to **many ""bad end routes""**. It gives me chills how I could easily have ended up like the 16 year old boy in the news. My heart goes out to him, and those who are one bad school experience away from themselves being in some way like him too.

**Aftermath**

Someone from MOE called me to verify my principal's claim that I chose not to attend school. When I mentioned to her that I was barred from entering, she was alarmed. After telling her what happened in that school, she immediately arranged to transfer me out so that I could  complete my GCE 'O'-Levels, albeit a year later. The new school also treated me badly but it did not matter to me; I had already lost hope. It was not surprising that I did really badly, obtaining a score of 25. As my education records were unconventional, I needed the help from a social worker and doctor to enter polytechnic even though my score (barely) met the requirement.

Long story short, I was still discriminated against in my polytechnic. Some lecturers looked down on me for being an outlier with a bad background and denied me opportunities because of their prejudice. My peers also shunned me and spread bad rumors about me. However, I remain grateful to the few lecturers and friends whom I met that believed in me, as they restored my confidence to continue moving forward. I did well despite the odds, but that's another story for another day.

I still struggle with PTSD, with recurring nightmares that are worsening recently. I still encounter (many) people that mock and gaslight me when it comes to mental health and my education path. I have come to expect this of the older generations, but It's very disheartening to see even youths in my generation actively denying a person's narrative.

""But you're here, so it doesn't matter anymore."" 

""This proves that those who did not survive are weaker than you.""

No, just because I survived does not make the actions of the past right. We need to stop patting ourselves on the back when someone survived such circumstances. **No one should have gone through what I went through**. Period. It does not matter if they survived or not.

**My plea to fellow Singaporeans**

After that long wall of text, this brings me to a plea to you guys.

It is very easy to write someone off as a villain of the narrative without understanding the layers behind it. While we have been pushing for changes to the mental health landscape (such as Beyond the Label and the Youth Mental Well-Being Network), there's a lot more to be done. There are still many people who belittle mental health, and even now, think that people with mental health conditions are ""insane"" or not deserving to be in this society.

Like what I have mentioned to my friends, ""it's only when something happens to themselves or their loved ones do they truly understand the impact of their actions and the importance of mental health."" I do not want us to take a reactive approach. **Prevention is better than cure** — let's not wait for another incident to happen for us to finally take action. Check in with your friends from time to time. Provide a listening ear. **You do not need to be a trained professional to be a good friend. Sometimes, all they need is your sincerity and willingness to be the shoulder they can rely on.**

At the same time, systemic changes need to happen in order for our youth to get the help that they truly deserve. We need to move beyond virtue-signaling and comfortable narratives, and start having the uncomfortable talks; the real conversations needed for change to begin. Schools need to be held accountable for their actions, and MOE needs to acknowledge the extent of the mental health problem and actively take steps to improve the situation. **One youth lost to the system is one youth too many.**

For others who are struggling, please... Seek help. Find a professional that can provide the help you need. I know it sounds ironic because of what I went through, but bottling everything up and keeping to yourself can be harmful in the long run.  If you do not trust the school counselors, that’s fine; there are other organizations out there that provide therapy and/or counselling services such as Limitless and Fei Yue. And remember: Do not lose sight of who you are. Do not give up on yourself. Keep believing in Hope. **After all, what is Hope but our never-ending belief and perseverance in rewriting our fate to change things for the better?**

Thank you for reading this. While I know I can be too idealistic, I sincerely hope that we can work towards building a more compassionate Singapore, so that outliers need not fear and live in the shadow of stigma. My prayers are with the families of both boys; may they find some peace in these troubled times.",1626881366.0,lucielkun27

However there isn't much talk on *how* to get the help and the various approaches. It's a question that got asked often at /r/askSingapore, and I have gotten some private messages regarding it, so I thought to share my personal experiences and hope it'll be helpful.

**Disclaimer:**  I am not a medical professional. This is just my personal take and is likely to be 100% anecdotal. Things may have changed for the better or for worse, so if anyone would like to correct me in the comments, feel free.

**My sources are**: myself and other personal friends who had went through such journey.  I had depression and anxiety order since 18 and it took me nearly 20 years before I felt life is manageable. I tried all kind of stuff, so hopefully sharing my experience helps. I won't give any specific recommendation w.r.t to doctors or clinic here or via private messages any more, because what works for me may not work for you.

**IF YOU JUST WANNA TO CHAO KENG:** Know that you are clogging up an already overworked and strained system and taking time needed away from those with valid cases, especially if you want to get subsided rate. You also make it harder for those with real issues to get the empathy and resources they need.  Of course, if you are such a despicable person, I don't think this mild warning would do anything to change your mind.

**PREAMBLE:** Seeking help is not a sign of weakness. With everything turned upside down, the stress of day to day living and the pressure of society, it is easy to collapse within.

**1.** ""**I just need the psychiatrist to give me X and I be fine""**

When younger, I had the idea that all I need is to certain something, like a stay out from camp, transfer, more friends, more attention etc. and I'll be fine. I would bug the doctor about that because that was my obsession.

I'm sorry to say that never worked out. Recovering from a mental health issue took time and requires getting to the root of the problems.

**2. Psychiatrist vs. Psychologist vs Counsellor**

There are some confusion between the roles of Psychiatrists and Psychologists, so this my personal take on their differences and which to go to.

Psychiatrists are doctors and they prescribe medication. They *usually* won't listen to your problems when they come in, except for the first session that you met them. They are here to make sure you are adapting welling to the medication, adjusting the dosage if needed and prescribe you the next batch of medication. Also, since they are **doctors,** their notes and letters have impact and is given more consideration than say a psychologist or counsellor.

You need a psychiatrist if your condition are disrupting your daily life, such as going to school, maintaining the home or working. Some symptoms that suggest that you need a psychiatrist are: panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, extreme anxiety, extreme sadness (like, crying over a few days) and depression. The key word here is *disruptive*. If you can still manage your day to day routine while feeling bad, you probably don't *need* to see a psychiatrist.

Psychologists are specialists in counselling. They knew various methodologies and will prescribe one base on your condition. IMHO, people with issues neglect to see psychologists because it's hard work. I had to wait one month plus to see a psychiatrist but I could see a psychologist with just a two or three weeks wait.

You will be asked to write journals, keep logs of your mood, do meditation and engage in practical hand-on. I believe that seeing a psychologist is for long term care. Your brain would adjust to the medication and eventually those will be less effective and you would need to adjust the dosage or switch to a new one. So changing how we think and behave is important for long term because that is what makes life manageable.

A psychologist is usually more affordable than a Psychiatrist. Personally, I don't find going to a private one much better. It's always a luck-based process for me.

A counsellor is often the person you'll get if you approach a family service center or school. Some might be trained psychologists, while others could be just volunteers or a full-time employee at the center taking this on as a role. It is usually free though or cost next to nothing, so you may want to try to request a counsellor and see if you have rapport.

Seeing a psychologist or counsellor is a rather luck based process. It's common to feel that there isn't any rapport and it isn't helpful. Don't give up on this as it is needed for long term care. You have to be prepared to invest in at least ten sessions with one.

If you are religious and have talked about your issues openly, your lay leader may want to have a ""talk"" with you. Unless they are professionals, just take what they say with a grain of salt.

**3. How to get Psychiatrics Help**

***I need help as a young person:*** I sought help when I was 18, so I couldn't really say how to get help if you are younger than 18. I would still say the advice could apply but you may need to obtain permission from your parents. If someone has experience with getting help as a teen, please let me know and I'll update this section. Please talk to your teachers, school counsellors or even just call the SOS helpline.

***I'm a parent and my child needs help:*** The following section applies. I would say please be patient. It's not something like a flu or fever, but a condition that may potentially last a life time and require maintenance and long term care.

***If you get afford it:*** Getting private care is at least $5,000 annually. If you are willing to spend the money, I suggest just going to a private clinic. I will explain more about this when I talk about my personal experiences below.

***If you cannot afford private care:*** Go to a GP that you want to trust, and talk frankly about your condition and get them to recommend someone that they know personally. Usually, it will be from a non-public hospital. If you need subsided rate (but don't mind slowly waiting time), tell the GP, and the GP will write a letter addressed to a polyclinic doctor asking them to write you a letter for the specific doctor and to get subsided rate.

*My advice is never go to the polyclinic without a recommended doctor*. If the GP says ""I am going to recommend the polyclinic doctor to give you subsided rate at <hospital>"" but gave no specific doctor (or had no one in mind), try another GP.

**IMHO: It's not a good idea to go the polyclinic and ask for a referral without getting a recommendation first.**

My personal advice is also to avoid IMH like the blazes. I am saying this based on 100% anecdotal data, so feel free to ignore this.

**I NEED IMMEDIATE HELP:** If you are feeling really bad, and is on the verge of self harm or ending it all, or about to do something destructive that you will regret later, *check yourself into the closest Accidents and Emergency*.

**4. How to get Counseling / Psychologist Help**

***If you need an affordable solution:*** You can approach a family service center for help however be prepared to wait as their manpower are usually stretched out tight.  You can also get the psychiatrist you are seeing (if you are) to recommend one, or get a recommendation from a GP.

***If you can afford a good one:*** Just let your GP know that you can afford private care and if they give a specific recommendation, try it out.

In my experiences, getting a counsellor from a private clinic didn't always mean a better in quality than a public or non-subsided hospital.

**5. Private vs. public psychiatrists**

Finding medication that works for you is a trial and error process. Medication that used to work for me gave me terrible side effects until I re-took them after a long hiatus.

When you see a doctor at a public hospital, they have so much backlog that they could only see you like once per month. During that time, you may have side effects or the medication wasn't effective, and you had to go through an entire 4 weeks enduring your conditions first.

At a private clinic, they will see you more often (because they could afford). My personal experience was after the first session with a private doctor, the follow up was one week later so that they could adjust the medication to suit me better.

So this is one thing to consider. I am not saying seeing a private psychiatrist is a surefire way to get cure or is objectively 100% better all the time, but the odds are just higher.

**6. I need to get out of my house**

I do know that there are shelters for abuse and vulnerable victims. You may try to seek those out if your situation is bad.",1630223827.0,derailedthoughts

27,Mental health support in schools are simply band aids. (helping my friend u/SeaDealer8733 post as they don't have enough karma),439,opcbhp,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/opcbhp/mental_health_support_in_schools_are_simply_band/,65,"The levels of support in schools are not only ineffective in encouraging students to seek professional help, it often worsens the situation. 

According to a Singapore Mental Health Study, while one in seven in Singapore have experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime, more than three quarters do not seek any professional help. When people with mental health issues go untreated, or when treatment is delayed, it can make life unbearable for both the people who have them and those around them. At the same time, these problems can have a wider effect on society as a whole.

As MOE has enhanced efforts to combat the mental health crisis in schools, it is evident that mental health issues among children and youths remain a pressing national challenge. Yet, more and more students are falling through the cracks, and there seems to be a problem solution mismatch on how MOE is tackling this issue. The very people they are trying to help, students who require professional treatment, aren’t getting any. 

One, MOE not only does nothing to reduce the stigma against professional help seeking, but worsens it. 

As part of Mental Health Education in the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum, students learn about mental health issues, coping skills, emotional regulation and help-seeking strategies.

Yet, these lessons do not offer effective help for students with pre-existing mental health conditions, which is the very core of the problem regarding poor mental health in schools. 

Take for example, growth mindsets.

Though studies have shown that adopting a growth mindset is beneficial to a student's mental health, it might be hard for students with pre-existing mental health conditions to do so. One study of 59 students suggests that mental health affects your mindset. Its findings showed that students with significantly worse mental health had larger increases in fixed mindsets across a school year when compared with students with fewer mental health problems. Mindset-mental-health link could be a two-way street, with fixed mindsets and mental health issues affecting each other over time. A growth mindset is not the end all solution that the CCE lessons promises it to be. In fact, it only serves to help those without pre-existing mental health conditions. For those with pre-existing mental health conditions, telling them to adopt a growth mindset is not only invalidating their experiences, but a plaster to a bullet wound. 

Another example is in RVHS’s Care Officers, which claim to help the students with trauma from the incident. However, according from students in RVHS, the care officers were just teachers with minimal training, and did not give them any help other than basic “coping mechanisms” like journaling. This is like putting a band aid to a bullet wound, and boasting about how well they’ve done to help the students heal. 

By ignoring students showing symptoms of mental health conditions and claiming to help them, it makes the student feel as if no one can help them. It perpetuates the idea that mental health conditions depends on the attitude or mindset of the student, thus cultivating a culture of shame on students who do not have control over their own thoughts and emotions due to mental health issues. Students are expected to fix themselves in order to stay within the norm, which serves as a barrier to professional mental health support.

In order to combat the issue at its core - MOE has to focus on the very students they are trying to help.

Furthermore, MOE presents talking to teachers and peers as a suitable substitute for proper mental health treatment. Through the Peer Support Leaders (PSL) program, students and teachers are made responsible for their peers’ mental health, with no mention of advising distressed students to receive professional help. The training peers and teachers are given is insufficient to take the place of professionals who have studied in this area for a minimum of four years. 

This stigma acts as both an emotional and legal barrier to help seeking: Students not only are stigmatized for wanting to seek professional help outside of school, parents may also fear the judgements of others and deny their children from seeking mental health treatment.

Two, despite the well intentions of the school, performing acts of support without the explicit consent of the student can cause them to feel ignored, and deem the system as unreliable. This can motivate students to lie to prevent any more fuss, stifling communication between the school and the student. Such examples include, pushing students to open up, pressuring them to attend counselling, informing other teachers on the mental health of the student without consent or calling the student’s parents without consent.

Three, the lack of privacy in the counselling rooms can cause students to feel unsafe opening up to counsellors. Counsellors often have to report to a few other people in the system's hierarchy. While the reports are often just “for information only”, trust is broken the moment these reports start their circulation outside the counselling room. It is not only unnecessary to copy so many people in, it can hurt the student to have people whom they do not trust to have access to their personal situation. 

Four, the quality of the counselling differs from counsellor to counsellor. According to Prof Glenys Parry, chief investigator of Adverse Effects of Psychological Therapies (AdEPT) , “Most people are helped by therapy, but … anything that has real effectiveness, that has transformative power to change your life, has also got the ability to make things worse if it is misapplied or it's the wrong treatment or it's not done correctly.” Despite the counsellors going through similar training, there are still differences in how they practice counselling that may affect the effectiveness of the sessions. This not only reduces the accessibility of professional help to students, it can deter them from seeking further treatment.

Five, information on seeking mental health treatment is inaccessible for students in schools. This can cause misconceptions about mental health treatment to run rampant, for example, students may think that therapy is too expensive which prevents them from seeking help. Even if students were to do their research, they are overwhelmed with the wide variety of places to seek mental health treatments in Singapore and be deterred from seeking help.

To all schools:

We strongly urge all schools to train educators that poor mental health is not a choice, but is a result of factors leading to that. Since they spend the most time with students, their beliefs about mental health can easily spread to the students. This should be further established through CCE lessons. not use invalidating and stigmatizing wording in CCE lessons to describe the student’s mental state, such as “attitude” or “mindset”. 

We strongly urge all schools to include discussions of seeking professional help in CCE lessons. This will send a strong message to students that reaching out for mental health support is normal. By forcing students to go through their friends -> teacher -> counsellor -> to finally get to an ACTUAL trained mental health person which is QUITE A LONG PROCESS and makes it seem as a “last resort” solution, when it should have been the first.

We strongly urge all schools to conduct talks with parents regarding the mental health of their children and how to actively support them in seeking professional treatment. Parents are more likely to be persuaded by educators, and the talks can serve as a catalyst for discourse at home about professional mental health treatment, and hopefully reduce the stigma around it. 

We strongly urge all schools to seek the student’s voluntary consent before performing any acts of support. This is vital to ensure that the help extended to the student is effective.

We strongly urge all schools to collect feedback from the students regularly regarding the effectiveness of the counselling sessions on their mental health. The school should hold them in a serious light and make an effort to find a suitable counsellor that fits the needs of the students.

We strongly urge all schools to make information on seeking external mental health treatment accessible for students. This information should include (but are not limited to): pricings of various sources of mental health treatment, how to get a referral, differences between various types of mental health treatment (such as psychotherapy vs counselling), how to make sure a counsellor/ therapist suits your needs, and links to book appointments at the centres.

We strongly urge all schools to encourage students to seek parental consent for mental health treatment through CCE lessons, such as role play in class. However, the lessons should adopt an empathetic and sensitive tone as this process may not be easy for everyone.

We strongly urge all schools to provide more neurodivergent representation for special needs students. More talks and lectures explaining how neurodivergence works i.e. autism and ADHD, instead of pity-seeking donation videos depicting autistic kids as disabled and useless. This will eradicate prejudices and discrimination of these students.

On a similar note, we strongly urge all schools to streamline the process of providing special treatment for neurodivergent/ mentally ill students.  Currently, when a neurodivergent/ mentally ill student e.g. autistic student requesting for CCA exemption, the appeal process is extremely complicated, long, and stressful for the student. STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FEEL STRESSED OUT FOR ASKING FOR HELP. 

To MOE:

We strongly urge MOE to change the nature of the PSL programme. Instead of training PSL to report distressed students to teachers, they should be taught to encourage students to seek professional treatment. MOE should send a strong message to teachers and peers to not “fix” the students, but instead, offer an empathetic ear to their plight.

We strongly urge MOE to re-establish the integrity, privacy and trust of school counselling. People who have access to case notes must be themselves trained in the counselling field, and the Code of Ethics from Singapore Association for Counselling should be closely adhered to. This way, students will feel more comfortable stepping into the counselling room. 

We strongly urge a bill to be passed to allow minors to seek mental health treatment without parental consent. This ensures that minors have access to an important aspect of healthcare that is heavily stigmatised in society today.

Given that there is an ongoing mental health crisis in schools, ensuring that students receive the help they need is of utmost importance. We strongly urge MOE to take these suggestions into account. MOE should uphold its obligation to students to provide adequate mental health support in schools.

RV High incident was very big and got the nation talking about mental health. **However,** I believed we should not stop there as the underlying cracks in Singapore's society especially in the mental health context are still exposed.

I will say this. **There are incidents that have already happened and will happen in the future.**

Some incidents that happened recently include

* [Woman, 93, found motionless at foot of Blk 44 Owen Road](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oshc2y/woman_93_found_motionless_at_foot_of_blk_44_owen/)

* [JC girl climbs onto train tracks](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ow8tnw/boy_climbs_onto_train_tracks/)


While the government is still talking about the different measures and studies being conducted, we are still somewhat stuck here, incidents that were caused by mental health-related issues still happen and will occur. That is why all of us can play a personal part in ensuring each other's wellbeing amidst [the rising suicide rate](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/452-suicides-reported-in-singapore-in-2020-amid-covid-19-highest-since-2012) 

Easiest way to do is to check in on people and ask them how they are doing **especially people who you have not heard from in a while**. It feels good when other check on you and why not do it to others?

If someone is feeling very down and is sharing something that is affecting them very negatively, there are a few pointers.

* Don't put pressure on them to tell you anything they aren't comfortable with

* Don't diagnose their feelings. *We are not medical experts.* Don't jump the gun and straight away say ""I think you have depression""

* Talk about ways of de-stressing such as picking up new skills/hobbies like cooking or baking, exercising or getting better sleep

* Listen carefully to what they say. Don't need to agree but by showing them your understanding, it's a way of respecting their feelings

* Offer them help in professional support and ways to do this. You can accompany them to see someone professional. Try not to take control and instead let them do the decision-making

* Let them share however much they want. Just sharing their problems takes a lot of courage.

Below are hotlines you can call

* IMH 24-HOURS Hotline: 6389 2222 

* Samaritans of Singapore 24H hotline: 1-767

* Counselling Care Centre: 65366356

* Silver Ribbon: 6386 1928

* Singapore Association of Mental Health: 1800 283 7019

* Tinkle Friend: 1800-2744-788 (for kids)


**If you believe they are in immediate danger or sustained injuries that require medical assistance, you need to take action to make sure that they are safe. Call 995 if you have to.**

Currently it is P2HA and I too am feeling the pandemic burnout. Fortunately, the COVID cases dropped to double digits today. **Let's motivate each other, check on one another and keep pushing on together as one people and one nation.**

But damn it IMH. Why are your operating hours is office hours too? Some people need to work. Some people don't want our colleagues to know our issues. For me, my work doesn't have time off. While psychiatrist do give MC, but my psychologist can't. I have a hard time sticking to my psychiatrist appointment due to work. And my colleagues have been asking questions about my frequent MCs.


Here's my recent problem. They are thoughtful to call patients who missed their  appointment. I received that faithful call. I rescheduled my appointment.  But I blur sotong as I realised she didn't tell me the time 1 week later. 


And of course, the timing was bad. Nobody to cover my work at that time. I called again for reappointment. Jialat. Push forward to another week with my desired timing. I asked about my medication because I've been out for 1 week and until my appointment, it will be 3 weeks. 


""If you really need help, you can do a walk in at our emergency services.""


Biiiiiish. I'm not gonna pay $120 for happy pills. So I agreed to the new appointment date and time while thought I can tahan without my medications.


I was wrong. The withdrawal symptoms kicked in slowly. I thought I was getting clumsy, drunk, hungry, tired, being a worrywart and a case of ""wtf why am I not sleeping"". And this morning, it got worse as the flu like symptoms kicked in. I took MC and went to polyclinic.


I lost my mind when the doctors said that they do carry my happy pills and will prescribe for special cases. Why nobody tell me that sial? I was so happy that I could go home earlier.


But no.  The pharmacy ran out of my happy pills. The lady gave back my prescription and told me to go to imh or any of the  hospitals.


So, here I am heading to the nearest hospital so that I could survive 1 more week without suffering with the withdrawal symptoms.

At the time I was serving ns I kept telling them I was fine and everything was okay at camp and never told them anything. 

When I did decide to tell them it all went horribly wrong. I admit I was also in the wrong in the argument but I was expecting my parents especially my mother to be more accepting.

It all led to me not having a proper conversation with my mother for a solid year. Not until she met my psychiatrist and everything was cleared up.

In short, she has been having difficulties in her very demanding work, personal/romantic life and she lives alone, rarely leaving the house and meeting with other people. Her family and long-time friends are all abroad and she has struggled to find friends here, if not for a few people and mostly colleagues.

The fact that she needs help is not simply an hypothesis of mine. Lately, every time we meet she ends up opening up with me and letting out her *true* thoughts, fears and sadness. She says that she has trouble being honest with other people and often also herself, meaning that she puts on a mask so that nobody can see what she's really going through. Only with me she says that she can really be herself and she lets out all that she's keeping inside.

Yesterday she told me that more and more she's been having *dark* thoughts: *self-harm, suicide*. She says it would make everything easier to just not feel anything. She told me that this is not the first time in her life that she has been having these thoughts.

She has been seeing a therapist on and off the last year, but she's been delaying setting up a new session with this person (for months now). The main issue being that this is a person in her same work/social circle and she doesn't feel comfortable with sharing more. At the same time, she has been using this as an excuse to not find help elsewhere.

We agreed that I would help her find support from some other institution, so here I am.

This morning I called the Institute for Mental Health and they gave me some general advice. Of course they cannot do anything until she sets up an appointment. However the IMH is very far from her house (Jurong area) and I feel she might use this as another excuse not to go.

Does anybody have experience with this situation? Who should I refer to? Especially, west/central area.

Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who commented here. I'll take note of all these resources and of the suggestions you gave. As much as possible I'll try to be closer to her and involve her in my activities. Thank you very much for the help! :)

Initially it started with the job, then soon after things just started going downhill from there. I’ve dreaded this job for a while now, i dont exactly enjoy it, most of the time i feel lost and just don’t feel like its a right fit for me. My physical health has also taken a hit, for the past month i’ve felt nausea in the morning, chest feels heavy, lack of appetite, fatigue and its terrible. 

Tired of feeling this way, i decided to take the first step to seek help by visiting a doctor and then a counsellor. And after talking to some close people around me, i’ve finally decided to quit my job. Im going to tender tomorrow, and i have a few questions that i would like to ask:

1) Do i have to feel bad about suddenly quitting like this? Other than my usual duties, i have a few things im involved in, so does that make me look irresponsible?

2) How do i break this to my supervisor? I intend to say that the job just isnt a good fit for me. But should i include that its been affecting my mental health as well? Cos i would prefer not to tbh

Thanks for reading this, and i would really appreciate any advice. Im well aware that quitting without a job in the midst of this pandemic is a stupid thing to do and im really not sure what lies ahead in the future, so if you guys have any other advice, please feel free to let me know too.

This happened last year during one of my classes, where we had to participate in a lesson about mental health. Of course, with schools being schools, they decided to give us a quiz. On one of the questions, the quiz asked something along the lines of,

""Which of the following are true?""
1. People suffering from mental health issues should seek help
2. [Insert completely wrong answer]
3. Some people pretend to have mental health issues to seek attention

So I've heard many stories of people faking their depression so that they can stay home, or just posting a bunch of suicide-ish posts on social media so that they can garner sympathy from their followers. So, knowing all that, I immediately selected 1 and 3. And I guess in hindsight, it shouldn't be a surprise, but to my surprise back then, number 3 was wrong, and only number 1 was the right answer. Unsurprisingly though, I wasn't the only one who selected it. At the end of every question, the percentage of people who select each answer will be displayed, and the facilitator that was in charge of the lesson will go through each question and elaborate on why each answer is right/wrong. The percentage that was displayed for option 3 had a decent amount from what I remembered, which prompted the (surprised) facilitator to explain why number 3 was wrong. He mentioned something like ""people will never fake having mental health issues, and you should always look out and be there for anyone you know who may possess it.""

Which finally brings me to my question.

Have you guys known anyone to fake having mental health issues before? What do you think about the idea that people can never fake having mental health issues?

Since I've never witnessed it first hand, do you think that the stories I've heard were completely untrue and that they were a product of the stigma surrounding mental health? Or are those stories 100% possible and have happened to you before?",1615163395.0,cats_work

77,Serving NS with mental health struggles - what I learnt,399,gxr5kz,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gxr5kz/serving_ns_with_mental_health_struggles_what_i/,48,"Some brief background about me: I am a 19yo currently serving NS. I entered NS with a PES B1 status but struggled with anxiety issues for a while and have been seing a psychiatrist, from whom I received a memo just in case of any issues in camp. Told my platoon commander about it and after discussion I decided to carry on with the basic training as my symptoms had been in remission for a while.

I decided that the probability of me entering into a frontline vocation that might worsen my mental health condition was significant, and also felt some recurrence of anxiety midway through the training, so I decided to hand my memo over to the doctor in the medical centre. Placed on light duty until training was disrupted by Covid, and now awaiting posting to a non-frontline vocation.

I wrote this post because I just wanted to share my experiences and encourage those who are currently in NS and struggling with past or current mental health conditions. Ok so here goes:

Most people weren't hostile to me, they just didn't understand.

So the response of most of my platoonmates after I went to the medical centre went along the lines of ""you look fine, I didn't know you had this problem"". Thankfully I didn't receive any verbal abuse from anyone in my platoon, they are all great people with whom I shared great memories with. Nonetheless, some probably didn't know how to react knowing my condition, and may have some preconceived mindset of people with mental health conditions being ""violent, unpredictable and dangerous"" and so interacted with me far less than before. I totally understand why they did that and don't blame them at all. But hopefully through my actions of kindness I can change their perception of people with mental health struggles.

Some people gave well-intentioned advice but it did get on my nerves after a while.

I heard from my family members constant advice not to report my condition in NS, in case a downgraded PES status affects my job prospects in future. Definitely, that has to be considered for those considering working in the civil service, but for me, such advice was often given with the implicit statement that my mental health issues are somehow not as real or as damaging as a physical condition. Which honestly made me rather irritated. But maybe I'm just reading too much into it. But anyways, my advice would be to always prioritise health over wealth. Those who have suffered from mental health issues know how awful the experience can be during the darkest moments.

I think some people looked down on me because of my condition, but I won't let that bother me.

Especially some of the sirs and sergeants, who have this mentality that being a ""man"" means having big muscles and being aggressive and brave. To them, having anxiety issues is a weakness. In response, I quote a character from my favourite fictional show: ""if you know pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others. It is different from weakness"". A true ""man"" (or ""woman"") is one who can show kindness to others. And for us who have struggled with mental health issues, we have developed a bravery and resilience of a different sort, and I would say, a better sort than the gung-ho heroism of some men. Because while we are resilient in the face of our own struggles, we learn how to be kind to others, as we know that a smiling face can hide many personal struggles and battles. ""Be kind to others, as everyone is fighting his own battles""

And also, there are certainly many healthy people who use mental health issues as a means to ""chao keng"", and this gives us a bad name. But I don't let that affect me. People can think whatever they want about me. Definitely I want to find people who can understand and emphatise with my situation, but I'm not going around begging for sympathy. And I won't let some people's harsh comments affect me.

I expect this post to get some nasty comments. To my brothers in NS who have also struggled, or are struggling with, mental health conditions, my advice for you would be to throw such comments out of the window. And to those who are afraid of declaring their conditions, my advice is to always protect your health, even if it means ""losing face"". Because if you lose your health, you lose everything. Do what you deem best for yourself. If you don't stand up for yourself, no one will.",1591450733.0,user_terminal

**Discussion and efforts to promote mental health awareness shouldn't just be limited to one day.** I feel that this happens too often with these commemorations, including other 'days' such as Teachers' Day and International Migrants Day. While the situation has improved over the years, mental health stigma is still awfully prevalent here in Singapore, and few are aware and sensitive of such issues.

Those who don't believe, just ask around. There'll still be folks out there who believe that ""it's all in your head"". The acronym ""IMH"" still elicits a certain response from some, as if seeking help there is the same as going to prison or something. So on, and so forth.

The fact that [one in seven people in Singapore have suffered from a mental disorder](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-people-singapore-have-experienced-mental-disorder-their-lifetime-study-finds), according to the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, suggests that mental health isn't a small or trivial issue. Students will agree with the [statistics indicating that Singaporean students are more likely to suffer from anxiety and stress from their peers](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3017171/singapores-stressed-schoolchildren-show-human-cost-city), given how competitive, rigorous, and unforgiving our education system is.

Our adults aren't much better. In 2019 Singapore was identified as the [second hardest-working city in the world](https://mothership.sg/2019/12/singaporeans-hours-per-week-work/), with adults working an average of 45 hours per week, only behind Tokyo. We are commonly referred to as a nation of workaholics, and rightly so.

The circumstances are so favourable in causing people to develop mental health conditions, or even to amplify existing ones. And the fact that we aren't talking and doing enough with regards to mental health makes this worse.

We should try to talk more about mental health, and also at the very least interact with those who may be going through conditions with empathy.

Cheers!

I have had the misfortune of working under tyrant bosses. Every position that I have landed into so far in my 2.5 years of working is actually a ‘hot’ seat - high turnover. 

I think I am spiraling into depression where self-doubt, anxiety, stress, fear are my best friends already. I am really not ok. 

Not sure if you can see it but here was what I had described [job situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ik7p59/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/g3ly7r4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

TLDR: My mental health is suffering. Physical symptoms show. I experience dread and nausea just thinking about work. Working from home is bad enough but when I actually have to report back to office (where its just my boss and I in office)... holy shit the fear is real. I know I wont stay long in my current position (definitely before end of 2020)  but everyday feels like a torture. My boss sorta knows my intention to leave too. 

But it is covid-19 pandemic we live in. Everyone is trying to save jobs.... people I talk to tell me not to quit. Because it is practical. 

At this stage, I have a verbal offer from a Ministry but as you know, they take a hell of a long time (this Ministry took 3 months to call me for interview). Some people tell me verbal offers dont count. I also have a few interviews that I am awaiting the results for... 
To some people, the above accounts for naught. But to me, they are symbols of hope. 

For myself, my savings are sufficient to tide me through 6-8 months. But what strikes me is the uncertainty and the stigma that comes with unemployment.

With Aspergers but dropout because of anxiety in school. Bright future gone, depression sets in FAST. Living with single parent (mother) in HDB rental, 1 room 1 hall nia. small but agreeable honestly, alive is good. Not optimal but not bad. Can get by.

But i think my condition getting worse, anxiety/panic attack started in 2019 December. Certain x activities started to become my triggers for the panic attack. When it happens i'm frozen in terror and need to sit around to make sure said fears don't turn out. Explains to mom, but she thinks i'm crazy, unreasonable. Continue to do said x things. Don't care about my condition. Continues life as if nothing has changed, continue to ask if i want x/do x.

&#x200B;

I think don't need to say, Mom is a bit narcissistic, a bit apathetic. University educated but not very interested in critical thinking, standard Asian mom don't like being spoken back to. Bad combination, cannot convince, cannot change, cannot even suggest she might be wrong. Her comments/suggestions/""life lessons"" are wild, random and often ungrounded in reality, but must take seriously or you're biased and ""always disagreeable to me"". She's supremely trigger-happy on blocking people on FB, should give inkling of what kind of person (apparently FB not enough of an echo chamber). 

Personally i think she has her own mental issues as well, i wont divulge here but she has tendencies of hoarding, as well as keeping rotting food around. Don't know if its the laze of disposing them or hoarding the food, even way past its edibility. But nevermind, no-one will know since she wont look for help and no-one will diagnose her. all is fine and dandy from the point of an outsider but i'll have to see/smell rotten food every once in 1-2 week or so. disgusted beyond words. Not even sure if phobia of x was sparked from this. 

&#x200B;

Then suddenly pandemic happen. Huat ar circuit breaker next, forced to be 24/7 with her (maybe not 24/7, she still insist to go out to mall for whole afternoon to blow air con). Go clinic ask doctor for letter to be ""excused from maskwearing"", cuz apparently she hates to wear. As the stay at home becomes longer, x becomes increasingly popular. Before CB, had verbal agreement that x is not very conducive to my welbeing so don't do x. Situation changed apparently, she doesn't care anymore. x is again back on the table, and any attempt to suggest not to do x is met with usual ""don't control me"" along with sprinkling of verbal abuse. Very standard asian parenting. I cry, she scream more. Scream even when i'm on the phone with IMH. IMH proceeds to tell me they can't do much, advice me to voluntarily admit myself to IMH A&E. Mom hears, immediately emboldened. Good job there IMH.

Apparently there won't be much mental health resource available, at least not from the hospitals. I feel like i'm on my own. very much on my own now during this period of CB, and ngl it seems like even beyond the CB. 

&#x200B;

I've seem a variety of professionals for help. Hospital, IMH, FSC, they agree got problem (other than the actual depression) but is family problem, so no active solution. Mom must willingly agree to talk. Mom ownself check ownself, no problem, no need talk. case closed. 

She's not going to change, my only option truly limited to moving out or on the lucky chance, someone with legal authority reaches out to her, with or without her consent (she can't block law, i hope). moving out is also difficult, i'm low income (more accurate no income atm), which really reduces open market options to essentially 0. Truly endless dispair with no real way out. She goes around touting me as a pity case to friends and needs money to take care of me but abuse me at home. Pui. Don't get me wrong, we do need some assistance, but she pockets them whenever i'm in the dark about it.

&#x200B;

I hope the sarcastic/comedic tone doesn't change the impression of how desperate i really am now. I only see bleak option ahead, no actual action to be taken except medication and beg that mother has the desire to be more understanding of me. Perhaps the lighter tone helps me grapple with the grim facts. 

Last 2 week ago i saw a post of someone's attempt. I'm glad he's alright. I always had thoughts but never really intent to. Its just scary to live life having to consider that as an out road. I take suicide very seriously, as permanent it is, it deserves its gravity. But i am the sort to be looking for a permanent solution from this nightmare, I'm just sure hoping it wont have to be \*that\* one.

For context, a good friend of mine is a civil servant who is a scholar. She did well in school, went to a good university and graduated with Second Upper Honours, and has a Master's degree. Having worked for 5-6 years, she is now around 29 years old. Last year, she decided to speak to her boss about her struggles, and decided to take a step back. She suspect she might be committing ""career suicide"", given the lack of understanding Singaporean bosses. Sadly, she was proven right in retrospect, because her opening up did more harm than good. She now blames herself for not having being quiet about it as things would actually have been better than way. Her speaking out about her issues made her civil service job untenable. For those in civil service or in the military and know of the concept of ""CEP"" (civil service current estimated potential, which charts and predicts your career track), she also thinks that  her CEP was downgraded on the basis of ""lack of capacity and ability to work"".

There is also worry that she will be ""managed out"" as she is invariably underperforming. The circuit-breaker isn't helping either. Is there a way to help? More talks with her boss? Or is the only way a job switch, in this horrendous market Any advice at all would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

Thanks!

Edit 2: Thank you for all the thoughtful advice and sharing of experiences. I will
share this page with her and she can work through them and discuss them with me.",1589092493.0,hoeconna

*Sorry, no video, my phone’s camera mic couldn’t pick up the audio.*

In case you were interested, he kicked the concert off with (or at least I was woken up by) 趁早, raising the key a semitone at the end of each chorus, a la classic 蕭敬騰 but this one is more like *siao ding dong*. Then he melted the neighbourhood’s heart with 告白氣球, although I still don’t understand why Jay Chou would wanna sue a white balloon, the falsetto made me look past the terrible singing.

All in all, *bo pian* lah, *kena* woken up already, just enjoy the show and laugh it off lor, make a shit post about it here and hope to reap some imaginary internet points.

I've been suffering from both depression and an anxiety disorder for about 4 years now, The news, to me, has always profiteered off daily tragedy, but particularly so during this pandemic. It's been extremely difficult to cut off from a constant bombardment of negativity, it's literally everywhere. Particularly, it's been taking a big toll on my mental health, directly and indirectly: my friends are stuck home and I've been overthinking things constantly.

I current fill the void in activities by gaming, some exercise, and Tinder swiping (and Grindr, because i'm very gay haha). Not sure if these are the healthiest ways, but am trying!

Any suggestions on coping mechanisms or how you've been dealing with the virus?",1585405222.0,cryptonitr

99,I need help on my mental health.,48,g632hj,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g632hj/i_need_help_on_my_mental_health/,19,"Hi everyone, I’m filing a PPO againts my father and I need it to be good enough for the court to take me seriously.

I need your honest opinion on will I be wasting my time or do you think I have a fair chance to win my case. I would ask the opinion of friends/family but I do not want a potentially biased view.

This is my story:


When I was younger, my father would constantly punish me by beating me up, slapping me or throw things near me. One of the items he used to throw away was my bicycle and my goods in front of my doorstep. The physical abuse stopped as I outgrew him physically, when i get bigger (around the age of 14) 
, but the mental torment still continues.

My father begins to purposely do things that irritates and causes me mental discomfort whenever things do not go his way. He will make irrational accusations towards me and when I tried to defend my rights rationally, he begins to call me slurs constantly and starts to imply demeaning words that made me questioned my worth. 

90% of the arguments boils down to him having an irrational or having bad thoughts about me regardless what I do or him communicating his terms poorly. These ill thoughts about me are usually based on his own assumptions without investigating the matter at hand. He will give an instruction/rule “A” today and I will comply but as weeks or month pasts, I will get scolded for doing as per instruction/rule “A” as he changed the instructions/rule to “B” without communicating his thoughts clearly. This often leaves me in a confused state and kills my self-confidence and self-worth. He will constantly bring up matters that happened years ago as a leverage to his arguments but when the same is being done towards, he will refuse to listen or accept it. This puts myself on edge not knowing if my actions (regardless how positive) will result in consequences or not. When his miscommunication is being pointed out, he will refuse to admit his wrong.

Over 10++ years, all these experiences have made me feel traumatised by loud noises and I feel afraid every time he is around. When confronted, he will ""apologies"" sarcastically and continue his negative behaviour without comprehending the matter in hand. When the topic of Divorce (for my mother) or applying for PPO he will make desperate promises and begin to hit his head on the wall or other unorthodox methods that will strike fear in me and my mom. We always give in and give him ample chances however; the situation will never get better. It will feel like a time bomb before he starts to provoke and use demeaning words again.

My father does not respect my personal boundaries often, provoking me mentally when I have my anxiety breakdowns. For example, he continues making loud noises (like throwing plates and cups when doing the dishes or slamming household items). 

He will begin to use Religion views or threaten to sabotage something that is important to me (example, he pulled similar ""trick"" on the morning of my engagement which causes my fiancee's family to question his behaviour which embarrassed me and could jeopardise my happiness. This is done purposefully in order to get me to comply) for his benefit and striking fear in me in order to remain in control or in power. When I try to talk things out rationally he will refuse to listen and when things get bad, he will begin to start self harming in order for us to comply to his terms.
As of right now, I am not able to live in the same roof as him. Every single noise makes my body twitch and my face pale. I will begin to shiver and have anxiety attack. I do not feel safe around him fearing he will try to purposefully provoke my mental state. He will always use the term ""I didint beat you up so why are you afraid"" as a justification of his actions.

These events are scattered over the years and it happens too many times which makes it hard for me to point out the date or day these things happen.",1587568983.0,xentricescp
