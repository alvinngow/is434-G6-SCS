.
This is one of my proud creation (for fundraising) for January using various wax meat from @goldenbridgefoodsofficial 
.
Mama had almost forgotten about this dish. Because the last time I had, it was nearly 20 years back. This dish is a must-have among Cantonese during CNY. And when mama proposed preparing it, everyone went ‘huh’? This shows that we are not Cantonese. 
.
Anyway, this dish has been around for a long time (during the pre-refrigeration era), and eaten whenever there’s an occasion. Meats are cured for months and when new year comes, it will be served as part of a festive dish. 
.
So mama is super nervous during the preparation. Not sure how it taste and look like; no reference to it expect for images found via internet.
.
This dish turns out a hit and beautifully cooked. The smell of cured meat with seaseme oil is a perfect combination! 
.
It’s not that difficult to prepare actually. Swipe left to view the recipe!! If you are cooking this dish rem to use Low sodium soy sauce from @leekumkeesg . The cured meats has its own salty and unique flavour. Hence you won’t want your rice too be too salty as well. 
.
On a side note, OST holding will pledge $20 if you cook with any of their Brands & products:
.
Golden Bridge
Kelly’s
GB Golden Lion
Orchid Brand
El-Dina

The committee was honoured to have met up with Singapore Children's Society's Chairman and JCI Senator Koh Choon Hui, DUBC, who was also 1968 JCI Singapore Past President.

JCI Senator Koh has shared many nuggets of wisdom on both his personal career and JCI journey - his mindset, his experience as well as his passion of contributing to society and to the next generation. The committee is grateful for the insightful session by JCI Senator Koh.

Huge thanks to Singapore Children's Society for presenting us with a token of appreciation, hand-drawn by one of their beneficiaries.

We quote from the movie, Zootopia (featured in the token of appreciation):

""No matter what kind of person you are, I implore you: Try. Try to make the world a better place. Look inside yourself and recognise that change starts with you.""

Thank you for joining us to make a child happy this Children's Day.

2021 has certainly been a challenging year for everyone. Busy hawker centres were open only for takeaways, non-essential shops were shuttered, and offices were closed as working from home became the new normal. Travelling abroad became a massive challenge, with countries imposing restrictions on visitors to protect themselves from imported cases.

Therefore, Lussocitta have decided to help up those who are in need during this tough period. Join us in giving back to the vulnerable amongst us this November & December period.

From 9 November to 11 November, in conjunction with our 11.11 Sales, Lusso Citta will be donating $10 to Singapore Children’s Society for every purchase made on our website, Shopee and Lazada platform.

We are grateful that Mdm President Halimah wrote about the issue of child sexual abuse—and in particular, abuse that happens within the home or family. She is right: we can definitely do more to protect children from sexual predators. 

Our stomachs churn too, when we read about such cases. That is precisely why we created our body safety division, Body Smarts Through Movement Arts, and why as dance artists, we integrate body safety principles within our dance performances and classes. We believe that the most important way to prevent child sexual abuse—to protect children from perpetrators, and from becoming perpetrators themselves—is to focus on early education about respect and boundaries.

I rely on a couple of books and programmes as resources to educate my children about body safety and protection against sexual abuse. @sgchildrensoc has a wealth of resources (KidzLive: I can Protect Myself programme, picture book, videos and handouts) for parents/caregivers to tap on. 

As a parent, I have to be hyper vigilant and proactive. 

More information on resources regarding this topic can be found in my highlight “Sexual Abuse”.

The topic of discussion encompassed upcoming plans that our community partners have in their pipeline to further strengthen the support of our Yishun community. 

Through the breakout sessions, we saw how enthusiastic and thoughtful our community partners were in coming together to connect and collaborate for one another's causes and efforts. The Kampung Spirit really shone throughout the Kopi Session! 🏘

We value how eager and ready our partners were in sharing their own resources to complement services of one another. Together, we can develop a robust caring ecosystem in town and continue to make Yishun a caring and inclusive home.

If your organisation wishes to make a difference in the Yishun community, do join our next Kopi Session in the following quarter! Please reach out to us by emailing Ms. Rebecca at rebeccathng@campusimpact.org.sg.

Sexual violence is a crisis in Singapore. We’ve worked with Women Unbounded (@women.unbounded) to gather a sample of hundreds of news reports from 2017 to 2021, to produce Singapore’s first ever data story on this topic.

Thousands of victims are violated each year, and only a fraction of them ever share—let alone report—what they’ve been through. Unlike other crimes, victims bear the blame and shame that should be the perpetrators’. Victims face blame for where they go, how they look, and whom they interact with.

But the data shows that victims are hurt in spaces we’re all supposed to feel safe in, and in relationships inevitable in life. As a society, we need to do better. We need to go beyond the law and fundamentally rethink gender and sexuality. Through better education, media, and community care resources, we can and must change these attitudes and beliefs around sexual violence.

Link in bio.

9/9/2021 Editor's note: The story has been updated to amend a factual inaccuracy. The original version had stated that ""Between 2017 and 2019, 9,200 cases involved the young and vulnerable"". The correct range from the source, 2017-2020, is now reflected in the story.

Not all of us are blessed to grow and be nurtured in a safe home environment. The society is fortunate to have homes like Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society to care for these children, regardless of race and religion, lending them all the support that they’ll need to be able to thrive in their growing-up years.

Recently, I had the opportunity to partner with PayPal for their #PayPalGiveBack campaign, and with the help of CHARLES & KEITH, we put a smile on some these children’s faces through these goodie bags lovingly packed by @CharlesKeithOfficial. 

Additionally, @CharlesKeithOfficial has made a donation to @sgchildrensoc ‘s corporate giving programme, 1000 Enterprises for Children-in-Need (1000E) . All funds to the programme will be used to support Singapore Children’s Society and the programmes and services across SCS's 12 service centres islandwide.

We can also do our part and contribute whenever we can—for example, if you create a @paypal Singapore account, and shop online at @CharlesKeithOfficial, @bedandbasics, and many other merchants, PayPal will donate 3% of your purchase to SCS. It makes me so happy to know that we can do good when we shop! Visit http://paypal.com/sg/givebackMM to find out more.

In support of Singapore Children’s Society (SCS), the @bedandbasics team has carefully curated a set of furniture that will be donated to one of SCS’s beneficiaries who will soon be leaving Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society to be reunited with family.

Although I didn’t get to meet the children of SCS due to the heightened restrictions, I was happy to visit the BEDANDBASICS warehouse to prepare the items to be delivered to the beneficiary. It was also inspiring to visit Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society, a residential home and gazetted place of safety for children who have been abused and neglected.

I am truly grateful to SCS for running Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society for these children, and to BEDANDBASICS for supporting children in need. If you’d like to help @sgchildrensoc, head over to the @bedandbasics website—and, if you’ve signed up for a PayPal Singapore account, when you shop on @bedandbasics, @charleskeithofficial, and many other merchants, @PayPal will donate 3% of every purchase to SCS.

Together with our volunteers, donors, community partners, including beneficiaries, we also enjoyed fostering the Kampong Spirit by coming together to learn the ropes from one another to complement services, and as a SG Cares VC @ Yishun, learning more ways than one to better meet the needs of the community.

Through the various engagement and experiences shared, we hope to continue and strengthen the ties that bond us, and make Yishun a more caring and inclusive home for all.

She gave me a new purpose in life that sparked my journey to be healthier and more energetic as I grow older every day, so that I can spend more precious quality time with her and her brother.

Speaking of purpose, @charleskeithofficial came up with the Purpose Collection as seen on both of our feet. Thoughtfully made with materials that are kinder on our planet, these are shoes that will not only make a fashion statement, but also express an eco-conscious stance. They are also made of 85% earth-friendly materials, including organic chemical-free cotton and certified recycled thermoplastic rubber. 

If you're passionate about giving back, whether it's to the earth or to society, we can also help to give back to the needy children that Singapore Children’s Society supports.

Sign up for a @PayPal Singapore account, and when you shop on CHARLES & KEITH’s website (children’s shoes included), @paypal will donate 3% of your transaction to @sgchildrensoc . This is such a sweet gesture. Just imagine the smiles on the children’s faces. :)

Sleep plays a very important role in ensuring our children’s overall well-being. Did you know that school-aged children should receive 9 to 11 hours of sleep at night, in order to be active and alert in the day? According to a study done in 2013, only about 9% of children were getting the rest that they need.
 

Just like us, Singapore Children’s Society (SCS) is committed to promoting the well-being of children, including their mental well-being. Children’s Society provides various services to support, nurture, inspire, protect, and strengthen children, youth, and families in need. The Society also conducts research to gain a better understanding into the well-being of children, youth and families, and advocates for changes based on some of these findings.
 

They need our help, and I am thankful for this opportunity to be working with PayPal and BEDANDBASICS for their #PayPalGiveBack campaign, which supports SCS’s mission of helping children of all backgrounds. Sign up for a @PayPal Singapore account, and when you shop online with @BEDANDBASICS, and many other merchants like @charleskeithofficial, @paypal will donate 3% of every purchase to @sgchildrensoc.

Childhood trauma, depression, Sexual abuse is on the rise and almost 64% of people of Singapore have experienced a traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives. 

Most of the time people are so confused to talk about it. 

Seven local agencies focusing on community-based mental health services for children and youth - Acceset, Boys’ Town, Campus PSY, Caregivers Alliance Limited, Limitless, Singapore Association for Mental Health, and Singapore Children’s Society - have come together to launch Safe Circle.

Why do we love superheroes so much? I like to think it’s because we all need a bit of rescuing from time to time. Whether you were bullied at the playground or workplace, or experienced extremes of severe trauma in your life, we had all encountered ordeals where we wished we had been rescued. But superheroes need rescuing too - they face grief, personal tragedies, moral dilemmas and no-win scenarios - but they also show us how we can cope in the face of insurmountable odds. 

I am no superhero, despite the hashtag #docbydaysuperherobynight I wish I were - but no amount of gamma radiation, or superhuman serum, is going to turn me into one. I use humour as my ""superpower"" though - as I firmly believe that laughter is the best medicine. 

But trauma is no laughing matter.

I recently learnt that two-thirds of people in Singapore have experienced at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives, and that in 2020, @msfcares handled significantly more child abuse cases compared to the preceding 6 years. Growing up with considerable trauma can cause them to project these negative emotions into their own actions - most times at a subconscious level. It is thus on us as a caring society to be aware of these trauma and how it can impact on the community’s mental health. We must better identify the at-risk population by being more trauma-informed, in order to provide support to these victims, or to direct them to seek professional help.

Remember. Clowns cry too, and sometimes the widest grins can hide the saddest tears. These persons could be anyone around you. And it might even be you.

The platform provides help in coping with trauma, and also equips us with the resources to offer help to someone in need.

Worse, under peer pressure, I participated in being unkind to her. Being bullied can invoke feelings of helplessness, humiliation, depression, and may have a long-lasting impact on a child’s life. I often wonder what has happened to that young girl, and that shame has stayed with me for 30 years.
.
Singapore has the third highest rate of bullying globally. Statistics on school bullying in Singapore in a survey by @sgchildrensoc show that 1 in every 5 primary school students was a victim of bullying. 

Apart from bullying, there are many kinds of trauma that can affect us growing up. Some are obvious, like sexual or physical abuse, domestic violence, others are less obvious, like emotional abuse or neglect, cyber-bullying, or even a child overhearing frequent, intense arguments between his or her parents.
.
How can we help? We can learn to identify the symptoms of trauma, and seek help with trauma-informed care for ourselves or others.

Even the bully, oppressor and perpetrator could have adverse childhood experiences that contributed to their manifestations. 

Trauma comes in many forms and traumatic events include anything from being bullied in school, parental divorce, sudden loss of a loved one, witnessed or experienced domestic violence, to sexual harassment or abuse.

I was quite stunned to find out that nearly 64% of people in Singapore have reported experiencing at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives. It is also worrying to read that in 2020, @msfcares handled 44.6% more child abuse cases compared to 6 years before. 

Growing up with trauma can cause victims to project their trauma unto their actions. Hence, it is important for us as a society to be aware of trauma and how it relates to mental health. Being more trauma-informed, we can then better identify the vulnerable population, provide support and care to distressed victims, or encourage them to seek professional help if needed.

I started this joint initiative with my son when he was 5 years old. He hand - drew and coloured a series of 15 postcards. I realised many people don't receive physical cards anymore and I thought it will be a nice initiative to roll this out to encourage people to write and send cards of encouragement to their loved ones. 

Thanks to everyone's kind support, his sale of postcards generated a total of $472 to the underprivileged children at @sgchildrensoc in 2018. 

My son is into digital drawing and animation now, his account is @lpencilstudio. 😊 Hope you can support him there too. 
Hope we have the chance to do another initiative again soon.

🌟 Positive mental health is essential for a child’s healthy development & for their growth.

〰️ During this pandemic, children might suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, depression or other forms of mental health abnormalities that can cause them to behave in odd ways..

If you notice a child behaving in a different manner that is of concern, please ask him/her quality questions that will help them express themselves first...

👍 The first step is to show that you truly care and give them a listening ear..

Have a heart to heart conversation and see how you can help them.

If the conditions worsens, please bring them to a child psychologist or for counselling first before resorting to medications or treatments immediately.

A youth drop-in centre focusing on preventive and developmental needs through healthy recreational activities in which fun and social work intersect. VOX reaches out to youth aged between 13 to 18, underpinned by the Positive Youth Development framework to build on 5Cs - Confidence, Connection, Character, Competence and Caring. 

At the time, they were having an in-house tournament for Mobile Legends and youths were enthusiastic to ask me questions in hopes to seek advice to improve their gaming strategies. 
Apart from sharing my experiences of being a professional player and in-game knowledge, I wanted to highlight the positive aspects of gaming alongside the transferable skills that you are able to cultivate through gaming.

One lucky youth received the upcoming EVOS Esports Singapore Team's Jersey and I was glad to hand out some mask souvenirs from the M2 tournament through a mini quiz session as well.

Thank you to all who have donated the book to give to children who cannot afford it and to those who have donated cash. #covi #dinosaur #storybookbliss #purpose #meaningful #charity #britishtheatreplayhouse",Singapore,105565836144069,Photo,Toby Cruse,toby_cruse,Looi Teck Kheong @Instagram,tklooi,The British Club Singapore,thebritishclubsg,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,British High Commission SG 🇬🇧,ukinsingapore,Cecilia Leong-Faulkner,cecilia_leong_faulkner,steve p,stevepuc1302,Kara Owen,karaowen88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2488439243427096528_7519336243,2022-03-23T02:52:52.415Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

I'm happy to bring you another Singapore home-grown based e-tailer founded by beauty junkies (just like us!)⁠
⁠
AKB brings in vegan or vegan-friendly beauty brands that works, without the nasties. They believe in making conscious decision towards a kinder living, from their choice of 100% reusable and recyclable packaging to the launch of their own Kinder Tote.⁠
⁠
This year, they are working with Singapore Children's Society for fund-raising initiatives. 100% proceeds from sale of the Kinder Tote (painted by a beneficiary of Children's Society) + 2% of nett sales from AKG SG from 17 Nov to 31 Dec 2020 will be donated to SCS. I have linked their website in my bio, Go check them out and support @akinderbeauty and @sgchildrensoc this holiday! ⁠
⁠
Give and you shall receive. No act of kindness is too small and a little goes a long way.⁠
⁠
P.S. My review of the products will be in another post. Stay tuned, ok?⁠

One of their programme is ‘Tinkle Friend’. It is a national toll-free helpline and chatline for all primary school children in Singapore.

How about buying a similar gift for a child, the same age as your child? Someone who may not be fortunate enough to celebrate the holiday season and receive a gift. Every year I meet children who are receiving the gifts for the first time in their lives. It is the most remarkable feeling seeing their faces light up with joy when they receive their Boxes of Joy."" shares Ms Bipasha Minocha who received the ECF Innovation Award for piloting one of ECF's very first community projects - Box of Joy. 

It was a simple idea, but one that immediately resonated with parents and children. Since then, we have partnered with @etonhouseinternational to collect Boxes of Joy for more than 2,000 beneficiaries every year. Drop us a message if you'd like to contribute a Box of Joy this festive season!

Compared to previous years, the economic downturn saw fewer corporates coming forward with their support. Not to mention, a surge in the number of families are approaching the organisation to seek help. Some have lost their livelihood or faced salary cuts that threaten their ability to provide for their families.

We (founders) of Revamp Project would like to step up and make a change for the children and youths from vulnerable families who are affected by this pandemic. It is undoubtedly a very bold project for us to undertake, especially when we are just a budding start-up. However, we strongly believe that collective efforts can change lives and that we can make a change for the children. With that, A Dollar Movement, a fundraising campaign was birthed to show our support and let people know that every dollar is still able to make a change. We hope that this movement can bring about a positive change in Singapore, one that hits harder than COVID-19. 

We sincerely hope that you will join us in this movement of change, one that makes a difference for countless lives in Singapore. You too, can make a change simply by signing-off with your name on this post and share it on IG story to show your support in A Dollar Movement. Together, let us rise as beacons of hope. #revamproject #adollarmovement",,,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2440051310869198087_37545122565,2022-03-23T02:52:55.933Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

@MettleChallenge is back! First time I am involved as I couldn't join any of my fitness friends in this event last year. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The event was founded upon the simple belief that we can all use our fitness to impact positive changes in the lives of not just ourselves, but those in need.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This year's #LEADTHERACE is a leaderboard based virtual race from 9 Nov - 9 Dec 2020. There is no set distance or limit, but the top 3 who clock the most mileage will win attractive prizes such as Garmin watches and AirPod Pros!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Your support will help raise much needed funds that go directly to the four centres of Singapore Children's Society to support programmes such as CrossFit, Music, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Running for disadvantaged youths.

Registration ends in 5 days, so don't miss out! www.mettlechallenge.com/virtual-race [Link in Bio]

The GIVEAWAY will close on FRIDAY, 9 OCTOBER, 11:59PM. WINNER will be announced on SATURDAY, 10 OCTOBER via DM and on my INSTA STORY.

[REVIEW] 

I can tell you this is a truly Terryfic 👍🏻 burnt cheesecake. Instead of a charred, burnt (or chao tar in Hokkien) top, it’s topped with a sweet caramelised glaze. So for those who don’t like the carbon (or chao tar) smell and taste in burnt cheesecake, this is for you.

And the highlight is the oozy, creamy centre. Best served chilled, the core is perfectly molten when you take it out of the fridge even if you keep it for two or three days. And the cream cheese is rich and creamy, yet not too sweet or overpowering in cheese flavour. Just right.

#EaterriesCares 💜 

Every $1 from your order of burnt cheesecake, cookies and Nama chocolate will go to @sgchildrensoc.

.

If you have a kid in primary school and you have wondered if he was being bullied in sch or is he a bully in sch, this might be a great exhibition for you to start the conversation.
.

Collaborating with @sgchildrensoc, the exhibition raises the issue of bullying in a non-judgemental and kids-friendly manner, helping the kids understand how speech, action and responses can impact others, and how they can protect themselves and others too.
.

Follow the characters of Scribble Town on a quest, and through their interaction, children can gain a better understanding of what is bullying, how and why it happens, and the impact of it on others.
.

And its not only about being bullied but also about being a bully.

The quest ends without a clear bully or bullied. I like how it portrays each character as having been a bully or was bullied. Like in the real world, it's not always black and white.
.

It's a small exhibition but the lessons are big. Take this opportunity to discuss how some words and action might cause hurt to others, even if done unintentionally. Not only have your child reflect on himself but maybe parents too need to reflect on our choice of words and reactions too.
.

Scribble Town is happening at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall from now till 31 Jan 2021. Open Tue to Sun (closed Mon) from 10 am to 5 pm.

The exhibition is free to Singaporeans and PRs.

The year 2020 has been tough. Due to COVID-19 and recession, charities are one of the most badly affected sectors as corporate donations have cut by at least 30% 🥺

Growing up I didn’t have much. But I had help from government aid and support from random strangers who gave us food and toys during special occasions like Christmas 🎄 

I told myself that when I grow up I want to be like them too, giving back to society, particularly to children. I understand what it is like to be from an underprivileged, low-income family, so I can imagine the joy on the children’s faces when they receive kindness from strangers and most importantly it gives them hope that  society cares for their well being ❤️

During the circuit breaker, I thought of ways I could contribute to society. I started by  volunteering once a week with Meals On Wheels, delivering packed lunch to senior citizens living in rented or single room flats 👴🏼👵🏼

However, I always thought that I could do more. With my knowledge and expertise in the financial field, I decided to launch my first webinar on how to start investing for my friends and social media followers. We didn’t have much time to publicise the webinar much, but with God’s grace, 30 people signed up and contributed towards the donation to Singapore Children’s Society (SCS) 🤲🏻

I was glad that I had helped 30 people to gain the insight and confidence to start investing but more importantly that as a group, we could give back to society in monetary terms. The power of unity is unbelievable, we managed to raise $1,170 🙏🏼

SCS is a prominent organisation that promotes the well-being of children and shares the same core values as I do ; Compassion, Commitment and Integrity ✨

To all the participants of my first webinar, thank you. We couldn’t have done it without your amazing support. This is for all of us. Most importantly, this is for all the children that deserve a better tomorrow 👦🏻🧒🏽👧🏼🧑🏾‍🦱",Singapore Children's Society,1034086151,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2379844201549260998_12240765,2022-03-23T02:52:58.903Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

With the majority of people staying home, we all become less aware of what’s happening outside. Just because you don’t see it, doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.

Because life as we know it is over.

In the words of Minister K Shunmugam, expect “Economic devastation, businesses will close, lives will be ruined.” “Think Positive” will soon not be enough. We need to prepare mentally, emotionally and financially for the true crisis to come.

Perhaps business owners have a clearer view of the runway ahead, to see the turbulence on the horizon.  It’s gut-wrenching watching an Events company I’ve built for 20 years struggle to it knees in months
.
Where we are today, is the calm before the storm. While it’s important to “stay positive”, we must also become pragmatic. Can you expect to survive without 6 months or more without any income? Many Singaporeans can’t, and it’s time to figure out how we’re really going to “get through this together”. Not just by dreaming of our next holiday, or the first thing  we’ll do after.

It’s time for all those who are able, to pull someone else up. Send groceries to a friend who is struggling, call out a neighbour’s domestic violence @awaresingapore help a child in need @sgchildrensoc become mental health ambassadors @we.are.limitless  We can each do something, however small.
.
In a short while, the half of society that can help, will have to uplift the half that needs help. This is not the time to attack “privilege” but to accept that we’re all suffering in our own ways. Be kind, don’t judge, help others, be a good neighbour, take care of your mental health. This is the only way we’re all going to survive this together.

“There is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation... has a rendezvous with destiny.”
- Franklin D Roosevelt (in the midst of the Great Depression 1933)

Continuing our past tradition, instead of gifting each other presents, we decided to save this money and donate to people/organizations who will definitely have better use for it! 😉
.
Pros: ✅
1) No need to spend time shopping for a present.
2) ZERO waste generated.
3) Tax reliefs (for eligible organizations) – do you get tax reliefs buying presents for friends?
4) You feel good knowing you made a difference to others, however small, don't you? ☺️

.
The funds raised will go directly to the 4 youth centres of Singapore Children’s Society to help support developmental programmes for youth in the community who predominantly come from lower income families with multiple social issues. The lack of opportunities and resources have often placed them at a disadvantage comparatively to peers their age.
.
The youth centres provide therapeutic interventions to help positively develop values in the youth, focusing on their strengths and potential whilst providing them with the opportunities and resources to become the best versions of themselves.
.

.
The funds raised will go directly to the 4 youth centres of Singapore Children’s Society to help support developmental programmes for youth in the community who predominantly come from lower income families with multiple social issues. The lack of opportunities and resources have often placed them at a disadvantage comparatively to peers their age.
.
The youth centres provide therapeutic interventions to help positively develop values in the youth, focusing on their strengths and potential whilst providing them with the opportunities and resources to become the best versions of themselves.

.
I was meeting a friend on the flight, so decided to just hang with the boys. We went to the public playground and drank from the water fountain. The boys wanted to buy toys, I told them they could window shop. Jake wanted juice, I said we didn’t have money.  Forget about food. We found all status revoked, no lounge access, all my cards gone. Without identity and status, we were not welcome, had no options, in a place surrounded by people who had means. Not having money can be the most disempowering feeling in the world. If even for a brief moment, I felt like someone else.
.
I felt helpless, trapped, compromised. One kindly lady saw me sitting with the two boys watching airplanes take off, Jake begging for orange juice. She smiled at us, and I suppose if I had asked, she would have bought us a juice. But there it was - that sense of utter helplessness, of not being able to fend for oneself. Over time, it could chip away at your self-worth and dignity, and trap you in a downward cycle of poverty and failure. This is an incredibly difficult topic to tackle in Singapore, where the class divide cuts sharper than race, language or religion. Poverty can befall a family, swiftly, unexpectedly, with the death or illness of a sole breadwinner or sudden unemployment.

My friend arrived, we bought toys and orange juice. We boarded the plane and took off. But I couldn’t shake off the sense of profound helplessness and disempowerment. There are people living in Singapore who have to make a choice each month whether to buy groceries or pay for utilities. They live on as little as $3.30 a day for food. It may be shocking to think that there are those in desperate need living among us.
.
What if no one had come to our rescue? What if it were not an hour, but for a lifetime? Can we do more than buy a juice for a stranger in need, trapped in circumstance? Most heartbreaking of all, not being able to provide for my hungry children.  How can we help?

As a #parent, I endeavour to equip and empower my son (and all my biological/#fosterchildren) with knowledge on #bodyawareness/smart, understanding #touch and #bodyprivacy, personal boundaries, #respect, #consent, and all those along the line of #bodysafety education. 
There is nothing awkward about it. 
We have been having these conversations and stories are such a fantastic resource. 
_

Here’s what I do: 
1. Read books on body safety education and sexual abuse. 
2. Have conversations around them (Reinforce: importance on taking care of body, secrets about touching aren’t good) 
3. Empower my kids with skills and strategies when faced with touchy situations. 👇

_

Skills/Strategies when faced with touchy situations (curated by @sgchildrensoc): 1. Say NO 
2. Walk OUT
3. Tell a TRUSTED adult 
_

I will post more books on this topic in my stories. Will create a highlight for it too. May it be of benefit to all, inshaAllah.

Children should know how to protect themselves and identify when encounters are crossing the permissable boundaries. While we often educate children on stranger danger, we have come to an age where it is extremely important to also educate them on body safety as unfortunately, as incredulous as it may be, sexual abuse often times happen with the people they trust. It is heartbreaking seeing this happening and it is a need to begin educating as early as possible to protect our young children from falling victims to such predators. ⁣
⁣
This #kidlit addresses this #bodyawareness issue in way that is relatable and easy for children to comprehend. It shows the sequence of how the abuse happen - through befriending and teaching the child to having baths and inappropriate touches. The book also struck me that as parents we also need to be conscious and aware of the behavioural changes in our children and to intervene when behaviour changes are portrayed. ⁣
⁣
This book carries such an important message for both adults and children. We need more of such books to help educate the society so that such occurances can be prevented. May our children always be protected. ⁣

Lionel and his team of coaches bring to the table not only an extensive knowledge in the discipline of CrossFit, but are also terrific in engaging young people to enjoy the wonderful sport. This unique approach in coaching youth allows a holistic collaboration between our therapists and the coaches to develop positive values in youth to becoming the best versions of themselves.

She showed teeth when others of her own kind get near her but she is so ever ready with two legged humans. So Home is her favourite place but not dog park. ⁣
⁣
Maybe is her deformed hind leg that made her insecure but definitely our TLC healed her confidence and made her feel loved daily. My Son is a real hugger 🤣 and they enjoyed “hug and stay still” moment a few times a day. We hope she can stay longer with us.

We are organising a charity art drive and are looking for parent and child duos to come in for an art jamming session. Your art piece will be put on auction and all proceeds will be donated to @sgchildrensoc. Will Faye and you be keen?” .
.
Of Course! Faye would be delighted to do more art sessions on top of her usual once a week at #dalittleartsschool and I had always wanted to do something with her. It will be a great opportunity to bond over something as therapeutic as art with my child. .
.
Ewan came along and wow was it challenging to work on one artwork with three different ideas! #fayefaye妹妹 chose to paint this picture of two trees entwined by their branches to form the share of a heart. Ewan wanted another more masculine picture. They argued about pink sky and orange sky. They argued about who should paint which side of the canvas. Oh gosh! The other moms at the same art jamming session saw it with their own eyes. We were engaged more in a family fight as opposed to a family bonding session.
.
They eventually agreed on a midnight sky and Ewan helped with the background before he decided to go play on his own, leaving Faye and I to complete our painting. Ah…. Might as well. .
.
I was worried when Faye chose one of the hardest picture to paint. I’m that C art student in school. So really, I was utterly impressed with our final outcome because it looked really nice! .
.
Faye was meticulous with imprinting those flowers on the branches and there was a moment when she went overboard and painted flowers on the trunk too. I let out a laugh, “hahahaha Faye! Trunks don’t flower! We have to put them on branches!” I didn’t know how to correct those but the amazing teachers at school showed me how to do corrections with paint! I was so impressed and it definitely boosted my confidence in art when one of you DM me to say you would love to auction for it and have it hung in your living room! .
.
This may turn embarrassing because none of you may respond to this but let’s try! .

Organised by the good folks from @roundboxcentre for @sgchildrensoc, the event aimed to raise funds and awareness for youth in need, and also allowed us to meet new and old friends from the local fitness community. Using a secret carbo-loading formula involving durians and alcohol, we pushed, threw, jumped and lifted our way to take pole position in the Invitational Team Category!

Congrats to the organisers, volunteers, participants and beneficiaries - all the true winners at The Mettle Challenge 2018.

It's an opportunity to rekindle relationships  through a worthy cause: 😊Thank u Singapore Children's Society for entrusting me with this important task again.
It felt warm & fuzzy when Chairman Mr Koh told me (while on stage)"" It's good to have you back again""
.
😊It's heartening to see DPM Teo Chee Hean again as the Patron of 1000E and 1000 Philanthropists for Children-in-need Programme ...and of coz his SO who was often amused with me
.
😊After having met many of the generous philanthropists at various events, friendships were forged. And to have Philanthropist Jason Tang got up frm his seat just to walk up and said ""Hi"" to me was such an honour. His humble demeanor is a virtue & reminder for myself.

😊 Meeting old friend/ ""comrade"" @keweitay & bouncing ideas off each other for betterment of our segments was always appreciated. We love what we do✌

Since our launch last year, we have received much love from everyone - whether it's from our valued customers or brand reps. We feel very, very blessed which is why we have decided to share the happiness!

Our Petite Hearts Print Sleeveless Dress in Candy Red has been very well-loved by all of you and it has been our all-time best seller. In the spirit of a giving heart, we have decided that for every piece of this dress sold from 6 February 2018 to 8 March 2018, $10 will be donated to Singapore Children's Society. Customers who bought this dress will also receive a Thank You card specially drawn by the beneficiaries of Children's Society.
.
Established in 1952, Singapore Children’s Society is a voluntary welfare organisation with a mission to protect and nurture children, youth and families in need regardless of their background. We hope to raise as much money as we can to give them a big red packet this year.
.
At Kidscrafter, we always believe that price should not affect the quality of a child's wellbeing. With this fundraiser, we hope to do a little to improve their quality of wellbeing.
.
On our part, Kidscrafter will also be providing free local shipping with no minimum purchase. Don’t worry, we have worked it out with our courier to ensure your parcel of happiness will definitely reach you in 2 days’ time. We hope you will share our giving spirit this festive season. Be the heart that gives. Share the happiness.

Our sincere thank you for all your generosity.

We are so pleased our joint project #climbfuji  was a beautiful success with both Anya and Zoe successfully climbed Mount Fuji (3775m) in May with Amazing Trekkers Club. A month before the trek they began fundraising activities for 3 Organizations in the UK and Singapore. The charities in the UK are BulliesOut - Working with the Bullied, Bully and Bystander and Children with Cancer UK.

Although they aimed to raise $3000, with the support of family, friends members and staff of ATC and Poco Nido, they raised a whopping $7000. Congratulations to both girls for pushing their limits and for practising the virtues of kindness, compassion and perseverance. We are so proud of them both and have had a brainstorming session on our next charity project together. Zoe and Anya welcome other junior ambassadors to work alongside them and Tanglintrust School students to join them on their next adventure! #pushinglimits #climbfuji #soletosoul #forchildren #climbmountains #resilience #determination #grit #notglory #caringforthefuture #tanglintrustschool #amazingtrekkersclub #poconido",,,Photo,Nur Yusrina Yaakob,anisury,SisuGirls,sisugirls,Tanglin Trust School,tanglintrust,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,Hazleen Pan,hazzledazzlepan,Sole To Soul,soletosoulforkids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1613236383933520312_2524930344,2022-03-23T02:53:14.044Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

This girl, Zoe and her friend, Anya are 2 amazing children who have the vision to climb mountains for a cause and that is for children with cancer and to stand up against bullying. How amazing right? They are only 9 and 8 years old. And so, Zoe summitted Mt Fuji very recently and I felt so proud of her. 
If this doesn't inspire all of us out there to keep being active and also to spare a thought for others, i dont know what will. 
And if you are inspired, do help them raise funds for their cause. Check out their Instagram space to find out more @soletosoulforkids

Two years on, I am still filled with fond memories and wonderful friendships; I still actively bring what've we learnt during our implementation period to the events I help organize today. But my most memorable moments lie in my experiences and responses to our project initiatives. 
Carrying out Operation KIWI, in support for Singapore Children's Society (SCS), gave me a lot of faith. Time and time again, I witnessed our volunteers bring so much energy and joy into their roles. 
Streetsales were tiring, from logistical arrangements to the long hours on the ground, but the kindness of many Singaporeans helped bolster our spirits. We've had strangers come up to us to thank us or buy our volunteers drinks, or simply take the initiative to find out more about Operation KIWI. ""A little goes a long way"" sounds hackneyed and trite, but we've never understood the value of our small efforts until we saw our coins amass into larger sums and such valuable funding for SCS. To be able to create tangible impact, and to do so with others that share your spirit has been an extraordinary opportunity, and I am grateful for that chance. ~Chelsia Low, YFC 2015 Operation Kiwi, YFC 2016/2017 Alumni Committee #YFC2017 #Makeyourmark",,,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1478054168915978484_1754100429,2022-03-23T02:53:17.084Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

Big up to these kids whom I have been #mentoring over these few months, and now they have their #basics in #djing 
They have #motivated me to share my #passion for music and Djing with the masses. 
Thank you, and I hope you 3 will keep on #practicing hard and love the #custom #tees

Who knows one of them would be a dj/producer of the future.

I will be starting a project to help these kids further, if any #dj #producer out there have used equipments that you guys/girls out there wanna give to them, do let me know.
