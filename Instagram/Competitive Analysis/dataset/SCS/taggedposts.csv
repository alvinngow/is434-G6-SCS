.
This is one of my proud creation (for fundraising) for January using various wax meat from @goldenbridgefoodsofficial 
.
Mama had almost forgotten about this dish. Because the last time I had, it was nearly 20 years back. This dish is a must-have among Cantonese during CNY. And when mama proposed preparing it, everyone went ‚Äòhuh‚Äô? This shows that we are not Cantonese. 
.
Anyway, this dish has been around for a long time (during the pre-refrigeration era), and eaten whenever there‚Äôs an occasion. Meats are cured for months and when new year comes, it will be served as part of a festive dish. 
.
So mama is super nervous during the preparation. Not sure how it taste and look like; no reference to it expect for images found via internet.
.
This dish turns out a hit and beautifully cooked. The smell of cured meat with seaseme oil is a perfect combination! 
.
It‚Äôs not that difficult to prepare actually. Swipe left to view the recipe!! If you are cooking this dish rem to use Low sodium soy sauce from @leekumkeesg . The cured meats has its own salty and unique flavour. Hence you won‚Äôt want your rice too be too salty as well. 
.
On a side note, OST holding will pledge $20 if you cook with any of their Brands & products:

The committee was honoured to have met up with Singapore Children's Society's Chairman and JCI Senator Koh Choon Hui, DUBC, who was also 1968 JCI Singapore Past President.

JCI Senator Koh has shared many nuggets of wisdom on both his personal career and JCI journey - his mindset, his experience as well as his passion of contributing to society and to the next generation. The committee is grateful for the insightful session by JCI Senator Koh.

Huge thanks to Singapore Children's Society for presenting us with a token of appreciation, hand-drawn by one of their beneficiaries.

We quote from the movie, Zootopia (featured in the token of appreciation):

""No matter what kind of person you are, I implore you: Try. Try to make the world a better place. Look inside yourself and recognise that change starts with you.""

Thank you for joining us to make a child happy this Children's Day.

2021 has certainly been a challenging year for everyone. Busy hawker centres were open only for takeaways, non-essential shops were shuttered, and offices were closed as working from home became the new normal. Travelling abroad became a massive challenge, with countries imposing restrictions on visitors to protect themselves from imported cases.

Therefore, Lussocitta have decided to help up those who are in need during this tough period. Join us in giving back to the vulnerable amongst us this November & December period.

From 9 November to 11 November, in conjunction with our 11.11 Sales, Lusso Citta will be donating $10 to Singapore Children‚Äôs Society for every purchase made on our website, Shopee and Lazada platform.

We are grateful that Mdm President Halimah wrote about the issue of child sexual abuse‚Äîand in particular, abuse that happens within the home or family. She is right: we can definitely do more to protect children from sexual predators. 

Our stomachs churn too, when we read about such cases. That is precisely why we created our body safety division, Body Smarts Through Movement Arts, and why as dance artists, we integrate body safety principles within our dance performances and classes. We believe that the most important way to prevent child sexual abuse‚Äîto protect children from perpetrators, and from becoming perpetrators themselves‚Äîis to focus on early education about respect and boundaries.

As a local author, it felt extremely uncomfortable learning about a literary establishment built on misconduct. My heart goes out to the people affected. 

As a mother, I fear that I don‚Äôt do enough to ùô•ùôßùô§ùô©ùôöùôòùô© my children from being victims and ùô•ùôßùôöùô´ùôöùô£ùô© my children from being perpetrators. 

I rely on a couple of books and programmes as resources to educate my children about body safety and protection against sexual abuse. @sgchildrensoc has a wealth of resources (KidzLive: I can Protect Myself programme, picture book, videos and handouts) for parents/caregivers to tap on. 

As a parent, I have to be hyper vigilant and proactive.

Sexual violence is a crisis in Singapore. We‚Äôve worked with Women Unbounded (@women.unbounded) to gather a sample of hundreds of news reports from 2017 to 2021, to produce Singapore‚Äôs first ever data story on this topic.

Thousands of victims are violated each year, and only a fraction of them ever share‚Äîlet alone report‚Äîwhat they‚Äôve been through. Unlike other crimes, victims bear the blame and shame that should be the perpetrators‚Äô. Victims face blame for where they go, how they look, and whom they interact with.

But the data shows that victims are hurt in spaces we‚Äôre all supposed to feel safe in, and in relationships inevitable in life. As a society, we need to do better. We need to go beyond the law and fundamentally rethink gender and sexuality. Through better education, media, and community care resources, we can and must change these attitudes and beliefs around sexual violence.

Link in bio.

9/9/2021 Editor's note: The story has been updated to amend a factual inaccuracy. The original version had stated that ""Between 2017 and 2019, 9,200 cases involved the young and vulnerable"". The correct range from the source, 2017-2020, is now reflected in the story.

Not all of us are blessed to grow and be nurtured in a safe home environment. The society is fortunate to have homes like Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society to care for these children, regardless of race and religion,¬†lending them all the support that they‚Äôll need to be able to thrive in their growing-up years.

Recently, I had the opportunity to partner with PayPal for their #PayPalGiveBack campaign, and with the help of CHARLES & KEITH, we put a smile on some these children‚Äôs faces through these goodie bags lovingly packed by @CharlesKeithOfficial.¬†

Additionally,¬†@CharlesKeithOfficial¬†has made a donation to @sgchildrensoc ‚Äòs corporate giving programme, 1000 Enterprises for Children-in-Need (1000E) . All funds to the programme will be used to support Singapore Children‚Äôs Society and the programmes and services across SCS's 12 service¬†centres islandwide.

We can also do our part and contribute whenever we can‚Äîfor example, if you create a @paypal Singapore account, and shop online at¬†@CharlesKeithOfficial, @bedandbasics, and many other merchants, PayPal will donate 3% of your purchase to SCS. It makes me so happy to know that we can do¬†good when we shop! Visit¬†http://paypal.com/sg/givebackMM¬†to find out more.¬†

In support of Singapore Children‚Äôs Society (SCS), the @bedandbasics team has carefully curated a set of furniture that will be donated to one of SCS‚Äôs beneficiaries who will soon be leaving Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society to be reunited with family.

Although I didn‚Äôt get to meet the children of SCS due to the heightened restrictions, I was happy to visit the BEDANDBASICS warehouse to prepare the items to be delivered to the beneficiary. It was also inspiring to visit Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society, a residential home and gazetted place of safety for children who have been abused and neglected.

I am truly grateful to SCS for running Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society for these children, and to BEDANDBASICS for supporting children in need. If you‚Äôd like to help @sgchildrensoc, head over to the @bedandbasics website‚Äîand, if you‚Äôve signed up for a PayPal Singapore account, when you shop on @bedandbasics, @charleskeithofficial, and many other merchants, @PayPal will donate 3% of every purchase to SCS.

Together with our volunteers, donors, community partners, including beneficiaries, we also enjoyed fostering the Kampong Spirit by coming together to learn the ropes from one another to complement services, and as a SG Cares VC @ Yishun, learning more ways than one to better meet the needs of the community.

Through the various engagement and experiences shared, we hope to continue and strengthen the ties that bond us, and make Yishun a more caring and inclusive home for all.

Just like us, Singapore Children‚Äôs Society (SCS) is committed to promoting the well-being of children, including their mental well-being. Children‚Äôs Society provides various services to support, nurture, inspire, protect, and strengthen children, youth, and families in need. The Society also conducts research to gain a better understanding into the well-being of children, youth and families, and advocates for changes based on some of these findings.

Childhood trauma, depression, Sexual abuse is on the rise and almost 64% of people of Singapore have experienced a traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives.

Why do we love superheroes so much? I like to think it‚Äôs because we all need a bit of rescuing from time to time. Whether you were bullied at the playground or workplace, or experienced extremes of severe trauma in your life, we had all encountered ordeals where we wished we had been rescued. But superheroes need rescuing too - they face grief, personal tragedies, moral dilemmas and no-win scenarios - but they also show us how we can cope in the face of insurmountable odds. 

I am no superhero, despite the hashtag #docbydaysuperherobynight I wish I were - but no amount of gamma radiation, or superhuman serum, is going to turn me into one. I use humour as my ""superpower"" though - as I firmly believe that laughter is the best medicine. 

But trauma is no laughing matter.

I recently learnt that two-thirds of people in Singapore have experienced at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives, and that in 2020, @msfcares handled significantly more child abuse cases compared to the preceding 6 years. Growing up with considerable trauma can cause them to project these negative emotions into their own actions - most times at a subconscious level. It is thus on us as a caring society to be aware of these trauma and how it can impact on the community‚Äôs mental health. We must better identify the at-risk population by being more trauma-informed, in order to provide support to these victims, or to direct them to seek professional help.

Remember. Clowns cry too, and sometimes the widest grins can hide the saddest tears. These persons could be anyone around you. And it might even be you. 

@SafeCircle.SG (https://www.safecircle.sg ) comprises 7 local agencies that focus on community-based mental health services for children and youths. The platform provides help in coping with trauma, and also equips us with the resources to offer help to someone in need. As a parent, educator, helping professional or even just a concerned peer, check out their complimentary programs and workshops to integrate trauma-informed care into our work and lives.

Singapore has the third highest rate of bullying globally. Statistics on school bullying in Singapore in a survey by @sgchildrensoc show that 1 in every 5 primary school students was a victim of bullying. 

Apart from bullying, there are many kinds of trauma that can affect us growing up. Some are obvious, like sexual or physical abuse, domestic violence, others are less obvious, like emotional abuse or neglect, cyber-bullying, or even a child overhearing frequent, intense arguments between his or her parents.

Even the bully, oppressor and perpetrator could have adverse childhood experiences that contributed to their manifestations. 

Trauma comes in many forms and traumatic events include anything from being bullied in school, parental divorce, sudden loss of a loved one, witnessed or experienced domestic violence, to sexual harassment or abuse.

I was quite stunned to find out that nearly 64% of people in Singapore have reported experiencing at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives. It is also worrying to read that in 2020, @msfcares handled 44.6% more child abuse cases compared to 6 years before. 

Growing up with trauma can cause victims to project their trauma unto their actions. Hence, it is important for us as a society to be aware of trauma and how it relates to mental health. Being more trauma-informed, we can then better identify the vulnerable population, provide support and care to distressed victims, or encourage them to seek professional help if needed. 

@SafeCircle.SG (https://www.safecircle.sg ) comprises 7 local agencies that focus on community-based mental health services for children and youths. The platform provides help in coping with trauma, and also equips us with the resources to offer help to someone in need. As a parent, educator, helping professional or even just a concerned peer, check out their complimentary programs and workshops to integrate trauma-informed care into our work and lives.

I started this joint initiative with my son when he was 5 years old. He hand - drew and coloured a series of 15 postcards. I realised many people don't receive physical cards anymore and I thought it will be a nice initiative to roll this out to encourage people to write and send cards of encouragement to their loved ones. 

Thanks to everyone's kind support, his sale of postcards generated a total of $472 to the underprivileged children at @sgchildrensoc in 2018. 

My son is into digital drawing and animation now, his account is @lpencilstudio. üòä Hope you can support him there too. 
Hope we have the chance to do another initiative again soon.

üåü Positive mental health is essential for a child‚Äôs healthy development & for their growth.

„Ä∞Ô∏è During this pandemic, children might suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, depression or other forms of mental health abnormalities that can cause them to behave in odd ways..

If you notice a child behaving in a different manner that is of concern, please ask him/her quality questions that will help them express themselves first...

üëç The first step is to show that you truly care and give them a listening ear..

A youth drop-in centre focusing on preventive and developmental needs through healthy recreational activities in which fun and social work intersect. VOX reaches out to youth aged between 13 to 18, underpinned by the Positive Youth Development framework to build on 5Cs - Confidence, Connection, Character, Competence and Caring. 

At the time, they were having an in-house tournament for Mobile Legends and youths were enthusiastic to ask me questions in hopes to seek advice to improve their gaming strategies. 
Apart from sharing my experiences of being a professional player and in-game knowledge, I wanted to highlight the positive aspects of gaming alongside the transferable skills that you are able to cultivate through gaming.

One lucky youth received the upcoming EVOS Esports Singapore Team's Jersey and I was glad to hand out some mask souvenirs from the M2 tournament through a mini quiz session as well.

In spite of the challenges faced by COVID-19, I hope the drop-in centres will continue to promote the positive development in children and youth.",,,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,VOX @ Children‚Äôs Society,vox.44cc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2545771168681299073_1920119,2022-03-23T02:52:50.647Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

‚Å†
I'm happy to bring you another Singapore home-grown based e-tailer founded by beauty junkies (just like us!)‚Å†
‚Å†
AKB brings in vegan or vegan-friendly beauty brands that works, without the nasties. They believe in making conscious decision towards a kinder living, from their choice of 100% reusable and recyclable packaging to the launch of their own Kinder Tote.‚Å†
‚Å†
This year, they are working with Singapore Children's Society for fund-raising initiatives. 100% proceeds from sale of the Kinder Tote (painted by a beneficiary of Children's Society) + 2% of nett sales from AKG SG from 17 Nov to 31 Dec 2020 will be donated to SCS. I have linked their website in my bio, Go check them out and support @akinderbeauty and @sgchildrensoc this holiday! ‚Å†
‚Å†
Give and you shall receive. No act of kindness is too small and a little goes a long way.‚Å†
‚Å†
P.S. My review of the products will be in another post. Stay tuned, ok?‚Å†

It is the most remarkable feeling seeing their faces light up with joy when they receive their Boxes of Joy."" shares Ms Bipasha Minocha who received the ECF Innovation Award for piloting one of ECF's very first community projects - Box of Joy. 

It was a simple idea, but one that immediately resonated with parents and children. Since then, we have partnered with @etonhouseinternational to collect Boxes of Joy for more than 2,000 beneficiaries every year. Drop us a message if you'd like to contribute a Box of Joy this festive season!

Compared to previous years, the economic downturn saw fewer corporates coming forward with their support. Not to mention, a surge in the number of families are approaching the organisation to seek help. Some have lost their livelihood or faced salary cuts that threaten their ability to provide for their families.

We (founders) of Revamp Project would like to step up and make a change for the children and youths from vulnerable families who are affected by this pandemic. It is undoubtedly a very bold project for us to undertake, especially when we are just a budding start-up. However, we strongly believe that collective efforts can change lives and that we can make a change for the children. With that, A Dollar Movement, a fundraising campaign was birthed to show our support and let people know that every dollar is still able to make a change. We hope that this movement can bring about a positive change in Singapore, one that hits harder than COVID-19. 

We sincerely hope that you will join us in this movement of change, one that makes a difference for countless lives in Singapore. You too, can make a change simply by signing-off with your name on this post and share it on IG story to show your support in A Dollar Movement. Together, let us rise as beacons of hope. #revamproject #adollarmovement",,,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2440051310869198087_37545122565,2022-03-23T02:52:55.933Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

The goal of the service is to help individuals or families to develop insights into their situations, and better problem-solving and coping methods in handling and resolving their difficulties. Through receiving the service, individuals and families are helped to regain stability and independence.

@MettleChallenge is back! First time I am involved as I couldn't join any of my fitness friends in this event last year. 
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
The event was founded upon the simple belief that we can all use our fitness to impact positive changes in the lives of not just ourselves, but those in need.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
This year's #LEADTHERACE is a leaderboard based virtual race from 9 Nov - 9 Dec 2020. There is no set distance or limit, but the top 3 who clock the most mileage will win attractive prizes such as Garmin watches and AirPod Pros!
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Your support will help raise much needed funds that go directly to the four centres of Singapore Children's Society to support programmes such as CrossFit, Music, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Running for disadvantaged youths.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Registration ends in 5 days, so don't miss out! www.mettlechallenge.com/virtual-race [Link in Bio]

[REVIEW] 

I can tell you this is a truly Terryfic üëçüèª burnt cheesecake. Instead of a charred, burnt (or chao tar in Hokkien) top, it‚Äôs topped with a sweet caramelised glaze. So for those who don‚Äôt like the carbon (or chao tar) smell and taste in burnt cheesecake, this is for you.

And the highlight is the oozy, creamy centre. Best served chilled, the core is perfectly molten when you take it out of the fridge even if you keep it for two or three days. And the cream cheese is rich and creamy, yet not too sweet or overpowering in cheese flavour. Just right.

#EaterriesCares üíú 

Every $1 from your order of burnt cheesecake, cookies and Nama chocolate will go to @sgchildrensoc.

.

If you have a kid in primary school and you have wondered if he was being bullied in sch or is he a bully in sch, this might be a great exhibition for you to start the conversation.
.

Collaborating with @sgchildrensoc, the exhibition raises the issue of bullying in a non-judgemental and kids-friendly manner, helping the kids understand how speech, action and responses can impact others, and how they can protect themselves and others too.
.

Follow the characters of Scribble Town on a quest, and through their interaction, children can gain a better understanding of what is bullying, how and why it happens, and the impact of it on others.
.

And its not only about being bullied but also about being a bully.

The quest ends without a clear bully or bullied. I like how it portrays each character as having been a bully or was bullied. Like in the real world, it's not always black and white.
.

It's a small exhibition but the lessons are big. Take this opportunity to discuss how some words and action might cause hurt to others, even if done unintentionally. Not only have your child reflect on himself but maybe parents too need to reflect on our choice of words and reactions too.
.

Scribble Town is happening at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall from now till 31 Jan 2021. Open Tue to Sun (closed Mon) from 10 am to 5 pm.

The exhibition is free to Singaporeans and PRs.

The year 2020 has been tough. Due to COVID-19 and recession, charities are one of the most badly affected sectors as corporate donations have cut by at least 30% ü•∫

Growing up I didn‚Äôt have much. But I had help from government aid and support from random strangers who gave us food and toys during special occasions like Christmas üéÑ 

I told myself that when I grow up I want to be like them too, giving back to society, particularly to children. I understand what it is like to be from an underprivileged, low-income family, so I can imagine the joy on the children‚Äôs faces when they receive kindness from strangers and most importantly it gives them hope that¬† society cares for their well being ‚ù§Ô∏è

During the circuit breaker, I thought of ways I could contribute to society. I started by¬† volunteering once a week with Meals On Wheels, delivering packed lunch to senior citizens living in rented or single room flats üë¥üèºüëµüèº

However, I always thought that I could do more. With my knowledge and expertise in the financial field, I decided to launch my first webinar on how to start investing for my friends and social media followers. We didn‚Äôt have much time to publicise the webinar much, but with God‚Äôs grace, 30 people signed up and contributed towards the donation to Singapore Children‚Äôs Society (SCS) ü§≤üèª

I was glad that I had helped 30 people to gain the insight and confidence to start investing but more importantly that as a group, we could give back to society in monetary terms. The power of unity is unbelievable, we managed to raise $1,170 üôèüèº

SCS is a prominent organisation that promotes the well-being of children and shares the same core values as I do ; Compassion, Commitment and Integrity ‚ú®

To all the participants of my first webinar, thank you. We couldn‚Äôt have done it without your amazing support. This is for all of us. Most importantly, this is for all the children that deserve a better tomorrow üë¶üèªüßíüèΩüëßüèºüßëüèæ‚Äçü¶±",Singapore Children's Society,1034086151,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2379844201549260998_12240765,2022-03-23T02:52:58.903Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

Let them dream. Let them play. Fall. Fail. The tower tumbles. Try again. Building resilience by teaching them how to deal with the fallout is crucial. For too many reasons, some children do not receive this parental support. We all know this, but pause to really consider that for a long moment. How blessed we are! Because every child deserves a bright future, I am sure you want to join me in supporting Singapore Children‚Äôs Society.
.
I‚Äôm proud to partner with @avyanna_official to raise funds for @sgchildrensoc. Until the end of June, Avyanna will donate $120, from the sale of each piece of jewelry, directly to the charity to support and protect vulnerable children of all races and religions.

Kudos to Avyanna for launching this fundraiser, during this surreal time. Kudos to any of you who buy and support. You will gain a beautiful piece, while helping a gem of a child.

Life has changed so much this first half of the year for my family. As I reflect on the challenges we have faced and how we must continue to do so with grace & resilience, I‚Äôm grateful that we‚Äôre blessed with freedom to choose how to navigate through the storm. However some are less fortunate; circumstances render them less free to choose. So let us take a moment to think of those who need our help. 
Our campaign raises funds for @sgchildrensoc with @avyanna_official donating $120, from the sale of each piece of jewellery to children in need. Specifically, the money will enable their work in providing meals, counselling and mental health resources for children in vulnerable families. 
To support, please visit www.avyanna.sg, swipe to see a close up of their dreamy Freedom collection jewellery I‚Äôm wearing with this stunning  @jessicacindy_official gown.

Many thanks to campaign partners:  @iampaigeparker @jennytay_9909 @cherylwee @eyedoc_sg @iamyvetteking 
@melissackoh @wantingw & @mercurysocial for pulling it all together.

During this #circuitbreaker period, Children‚Äôs Society has seen an increase in the needs of its beneficiaries, and its social workers and counsellors are doing what they can to support them. 
The stress and fear children experience in this #COVID19 situation is real: they may have parents working on the frontline, parents suffering enormous stress because of financial issues or suffering from mental and physical issues, amongst others. Some of them may be vulnerable children living with their caregivers who may abuse them. SWIPE LEFT FOR MORE INFO.

Because life as we know it is over.

In the words of Minister K Shunmugam, expect ‚ÄúEconomic devastation, businesses will close, lives will be ruined.‚Äù ‚ÄúThink Positive‚Äù will soon not be enough. We need to prepare mentally, emotionally and financially for the true crisis to come.

Perhaps business owners have a clearer view of the runway ahead, to see the turbulence on the horizon.  It‚Äôs gut-wrenching watching an Events company I‚Äôve built for 20 years struggle to it knees in months
.
Where we are today, is the calm before the storm. While it‚Äôs important to ‚Äústay positive‚Äù, we must also become pragmatic. Can you expect to survive without 6 months or more without any income? Many Singaporeans can‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs time to figure out how we‚Äôre really going to ‚Äúget through this together‚Äù. Not just by dreaming of our next holiday, or the first thing  we‚Äôll do after.

It‚Äôs time for all those who are able, to pull someone else up. Send groceries to a friend who is struggling, call out a neighbour‚Äôs domestic violence @awaresingapore help a child in need @sgchildrensoc become mental health ambassadors @we.are.limitless  We can each do something, however small.
.
In a short while, the half of society that can help, will have to uplift the half that needs help. This is not the time to attack ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù but to accept that we‚Äôre all suffering in our own ways. Be kind, don‚Äôt judge, help others, be a good neighbour, take care of your mental health. This is the only way we‚Äôre all going to survive this together.
.
‚ÄúThere is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation... has a rendezvous with destiny.‚Äù
- Franklin D Roosevelt (in the midst of the Great Depression 1933)

.
I was meeting a friend on the flight, so decided to just hang with the boys. We went to the public playground and drank from the water fountain. The boys wanted to buy toys, I told them they could window shop. Jake wanted juice, I said we didn‚Äôt have money.  Forget about food. We found all status revoked, no lounge access, all my cards gone. Without identity and status, we were not welcome, had no options, in a place surrounded by people who had means. Not having money can be the most disempowering feeling in the world. If even for a brief moment, I felt like someone else.
.
I felt helpless, trapped, compromised. One kindly lady saw me sitting with the two boys watching airplanes take off, Jake begging for orange juice. She smiled at us, and I suppose if I had asked, she would have bought us a juice. But there it was - that sense of utter helplessness, of not being able to fend for oneself. Over time, it could chip away at your self-worth and dignity, and trap you in a downward cycle of poverty and failure. This is an incredibly difficult topic to tackle in Singapore, where the class divide cuts sharper than race, language or religion. Poverty can befall a family, swiftly, unexpectedly, with the death or illness of a sole breadwinner or sudden unemployment.

My friend arrived, we bought toys and orange juice. We boarded the plane and took off. But I couldn‚Äôt shake off the sense of profound helplessness and disempowerment. There are people living in Singapore who have to make a choice each month whether to buy groceries or pay for utilities. They live on as little as $3.30 a day for food. It may be shocking to think that there are those in desperate need living among us.
.
What if no one had come to our rescue? What if it were not an hour, but for a lifetime? Can we do more than buy a juice for a stranger in need, trapped in circumstance? Most heartbreaking of all, not being able to provide for my hungry children.  How can we help?

As a #parent, I endeavour to equip and empower my son (and all my biological/#fosterchildren) with knowledge on #bodyawareness/smart, understanding #touch and #bodyprivacy, personal boundaries, #respect, #consent, and all those along the line of #bodysafety education. 
There is nothing awkward about it. 
We have been having these conversations and stories are such a fantastic resource. 
_

Here‚Äôs what I do: 
1. Read books on body safety education and sexual abuse. 
2. Have conversations around them (Reinforce: importance on taking care of body, secrets about touching aren‚Äôt good) 
3. Empower my kids with skills and strategies when faced with touchy situations. üëá

_

Skills/Strategies when faced with touchy situations (curated by @sgchildrensoc): 1. Say NO 
2. Walk OUT
3. Tell a TRUSTED adult 
_

I will post more books on this topic in my stories. Will create a highlight for it too. May it be of benefit to all, inshaAllah.

Children should know how to protect themselves and identify when encounters are crossing the permissable boundaries. While we often educate children on stranger danger, we have come to an age where it is extremely important to also educate them on body safety as unfortunately, as incredulous as it may be, sexual abuse often times happen with the people they trust. It is heartbreaking seeing this happening and it is a need to begin educating as early as possible to protect our young children from falling victims to such predators. ‚Å£
‚Å£
This #kidlit addresses this #bodyawareness issue in way that is relatable and easy for children to comprehend. It shows the sequence of how the abuse happen - through befriending and teaching the child to having baths and inappropriate touches. The book also struck me that as parents we also need to be conscious and aware of the behavioural changes in our children and to intervene when behaviour changes are portrayed. ‚Å£
‚Å£
This book carries such an important message for both adults and children. We need more of such books to help educate the society so that such occurances can be prevented. May our children always be protected. ‚Å£

Making a difference is better done together and we‚Äôre so thankful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with various organisations to extend our impact. These organisations include but are not limited to UA, Again Faster, Far East Organisation, Queenstown Secondary, RCSS, NYC and MCCY.

From youth programs to corporate gigs to classes for the elderly, it‚Äôs all about forging elite lives and making people better. 3 years later, we‚Äôre glad to say we‚Äôre still working with most of the same organisations and many more!

This furkid had been with us for 15 years, since day one she is very much like to hang around with us only.
‚Å£
She showed teeth when others of her own kind get near her but she is so ever ready with two legged humans. So Home is her favourite place but not dog park. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Maybe is her deformed hind leg that made her insecure but definitely our TLC healed her confidence and made her feel loved daily. My Son is a real hugger ü§£ and they enjoyed ‚Äúhug and stay still‚Äù moment a few times a day. We hope she can stay longer with us.

We are organising a charity art drive and are looking for parent and child duos to come in for an art jamming session. Your art piece will be put on auction and all proceeds will be donated to @sgchildrensoc. Will Faye and you be keen?‚Äù .
.
Of Course! Faye would be delighted to do more art sessions on top of her usual once a week at #dalittleartsschool and I had always wanted to do something with her. It will be a great opportunity to bond over something as therapeutic as art with my child. .
.
Ewan came along and wow was it challenging to work on one artwork with three different ideas! #fayefayeÂ¶πÂ¶π chose to paint this picture of two trees entwined by their branches to form the share of a heart. Ewan wanted another more masculine picture. They argued about pink sky and orange sky. They argued about who should paint which side of the canvas. Oh gosh! The other moms at the same art jamming session saw it with their own eyes. We were engaged more in a family fight as opposed to a family bonding session.
.
They eventually agreed on a midnight sky and Ewan helped with the background before he decided to go play on his own, leaving Faye and I to complete our painting. Ah‚Ä¶. Might as well. .
.
I was worried when Faye chose one of the hardest picture to paint. I‚Äôm that C art student in school. So really, I was utterly impressed with our final outcome because it looked really nice! .
.
Faye was meticulous with imprinting those flowers on the branches and there was a moment when she went overboard and painted flowers on the trunk too. I let out a laugh, ‚Äúhahahaha Faye! Trunks don‚Äôt flower! We have to put them on branches!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to correct those but the amazing teachers at school showed me how to do corrections with paint! I was so impressed and it definitely boosted my confidence in art when one of you DM me to say you would love to auction for it and have it hung in your living room! .

This may turn embarrassing because none of you may respond to this but let‚Äôs try! .

Since our launch last year, we have received much love from everyone - whether it's from our valued customers or brand reps. We feel very, very blessed which is why we have decided to share the happiness!
.
Our Petite Hearts Print Sleeveless Dress in Candy Red has been very well-loved by all of you and it has been our all-time best seller. In the spirit of a giving heart, we have decided that for every piece of this dress sold from 6 February 2018 to 8 March 2018, $10 will be donated to Singapore Children's Society. Customers who bought this dress will also receive a Thank You card specially drawn by the beneficiaries of Children's Society.
.
Established in 1952, Singapore Children‚Äôs Society is a voluntary welfare organisation with a mission to protect and nurture children, youth and families in need regardless of their background. We hope to raise as much money as we can to give them a big red packet this year.
.
At Kidscrafter, we always believe that price should not affect the quality of a child's wellbeing. With this fundraiser, we hope to do a little to improve their quality of wellbeing.
.
On our part, Kidscrafter will also be providing free local shipping with no minimum purchase. Don‚Äôt worry, we have worked it out with our courier to ensure your parcel of happiness will definitely reach you in 2 days‚Äô time. We hope you will share our giving spirit this festive season. Be the heart that gives. Share the happiness.

Our sincere thank you for all your generosity.

We are so pleased our joint project #climbfuji  was a beautiful success with both Anya and Zoe successfully climbed Mount Fuji (3775m) in May with Amazing Trekkers Club. A month before the trek they began fundraising activities for 3 Organizations in the UK and Singapore. The charities in the UK are BulliesOut - Working with the Bullied, Bully and Bystander and Children with Cancer UK.

Although they aimed to raise $3000, with the support of family, friends members and staff of ATC and Poco Nido, they raised a whopping $7000. Congratulations to both girls for pushing their limits and for practising the virtues of kindness, compassion and perseverance. We are so proud of them both and have had a brainstorming session on our next charity project together. Zoe and Anya welcome other junior ambassadors to work alongside them and Tanglintrust School students to join them on their next adventure! #pushinglimits #climbfuji #soletosoul #forchildren #climbmountains #resilience #determination #grit #notglory #caringforthefuture #tanglintrustschool #amazingtrekkersclub #poconido",,,Photo,Nur Yusrina Yaakob,anisury,SisuGirls,sisugirls,Tanglin Trust School,tanglintrust,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,Hazleen Pan,hazzledazzlepan,Sole To Soul,soletosoulforkids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1613236383933520312_2524930344,2022-03-23T02:53:14.044Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

This girl, Zoe and her friend, Anya are 2 amazing children who have the vision to climb mountains for a cause and that is for children with cancer and to stand up against bullying. How amazing right? They are only 9 and 8 years old. And so, Zoe summitted Mt Fuji very recently and I felt so proud of her. 
If this doesn't inspire all of us out there to keep being active and also to spare a thought for others, i dont know what will. 
And if you are inspired, do help them raise funds for their cause. Check out their Instagram space to find out more @soletosoulforkids

Two years on, I am still filled with fond memories and wonderful friendships; I still actively bring what've we learnt during our implementation period to the events I help organize today. But my most memorable moments lie in my experiences and responses to our project initiatives. 
Carrying out Operation KIWI, in support for Singapore Children's Society (SCS), gave me a lot of faith. Time and time again, I witnessed our volunteers bring so much energy and joy into their roles. 
Streetsales were tiring, from logistical arrangements to the long hours on the ground, but the kindness of many Singaporeans helped bolster our spirits. We've had strangers come up to us to thank us or buy our volunteers drinks, or simply take the initiative to find out more about Operation KIWI. ""A little goes a long way"" sounds hackneyed and trite, but we've never understood the value of our small efforts until we saw our coins amass into larger sums and such valuable funding for SCS. To be able to create tangible impact, and to do so with others that share your spirit has been an extraordinary opportunity, and I am grateful for that chance. ~Chelsia Low, YFC 2015 Operation Kiwi, YFC 2016/2017 Alumni Committee #YFC2017 #Makeyourmark",,,Photo,Singapore Children's Society,sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1478054168915978484_1754100429,2022-03-23T02:53:17.084Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc,,,,,,,

Who knows one of them would be a dj/producer of the future.

I will be starting a project to help these kids further, if any #dj #producer out there have used equipments that you guys/girls out there wanna give to them, do let me know.
