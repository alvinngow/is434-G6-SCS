This portal also provides information, resources and tips on decision making processes, not just for divorce, but also for reconciliation, or strengthening your marriage.\n\nMarriage is about being a team. The harder you work together to make your marriage work, the stronger and healthier your relationship becomes. \n\nLove is not about how many years, months and days you have been together.

Or spouses hurling insults at one another in public? How can we remain vigilant and pick up on cases of family abuse before things go too far?\n\nJames and I believe that love should be at the root in all we do and so we talked about how this belief needs to be reflected in our parenting.\n\nIn the case of spousal abuse, a couple could appear loving and stable on the outside but be in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship behind closed doors. Apart from physical abuse, it could be verbal insults, put downs, over-controlling behaviour, non-consensual sexual advances or even financial oppression.\n\nWith the surge in abuse cases in recent times, we need to step out of our shells, come forward to intervene and no longer view it as a ‚Äúprivate matter‚Äù. Family violence is real and prevalent in our society and we need to work together to stand against it, and stop it.\n\nThe Break The Silence campaign by the Ministry of Social and Family development @msfcares aims to raise awareness of family violence and encourages bystanders to safely step in and intervene if they come across cases of family violence.\n\nMany victims could be suffering in silence without a safe way to reach out for help. The ‚ÄúSignal for Help‚Äù hand gesture (swipe this carousel) provides victims a discreet way of showing that they need help, and bystanders seeing this gesture should offer their assistance.\n\nLearn how to identify the gesture and what to do in the event you witness family violence.

These four years have been filled with wonderful memories, but also difficult conversations, tears, disagreements, which eventually always ended with hugs. Thankfully. \n\nMarriage is filled with responsibilities, home, children... It can feel like too much to shoulder sometimes. If you‚Äôre facing challenges in your marriage, feel helpless, seeking reconciliation, or considering divorce, you can find information, resources and tips on Family Assist. Family Assist is an online resource portal that provides support for couples looking to strengthen their marriage or find help on any marital issues. You will be able to find tips on building a strong marriage. The portal will also provide tips on how to better manage conflicts.\n\nIf you and your spouse have decided to proceed with a divorce, you will be able to find information on how to co-parent after divorce, and how a divorce can impact your children, housing options and finances. The Budget Calculator on the portal can help you better understand how divorce may stretch or strain your finances. You can also sign up for the Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP), and find information and resources to help you and your family during this period of transition.\n\nYou can speak to a counsellor online and seek support through a free-of-charge online counselling service by the Community Psychology Hub, in collaboration with @msfcares. This service allows for anonymous sign-ups so you can be rest assured that your privacy will not be compromised. \n\nIf you are facing marital, divorce and/or co-parenting difficulties, you may want to visit Family Assist at https://familyassist.msf.gov.sg. Alternatively, if you know anyone facing similar difficulties, you may also want to share about the portal with them.\n\nHaving a great partner in this union is what ultimately makes the marriage work. Grateful for you, @weipei88. I love how we always overcome our differences with lots of compromise and communication. Lots and lots of it.

One of the areas in the brain that receives pain signals ‚Äî specifically, the limbic region ‚Äî shares many of the same messengers as the mood signals. We know from research studies using neuroimaging that the parts of the brain controlling emotion and sensory features of pain are altered in people with chronic pain.\n‚Ä¶\nThere is a direct correlation between improvement in one‚Äôs emotional well-being and their experience of pain (and vice versa). Chronic pain increases the risk of depression and anxiety, and depression and anxiety strongly predict the development of chronic pain. This association is seen in conditions like fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, where behavioural and psychological treatment strategies have shown benefit in reducing symptoms.‚Äù\n.\nPsychologists can help address‚Äî\nPain catastrophizing: This is when you magnify the negative effects of pain and focus on feelings of helplessness while ruminating about the presence of pain in your life. Negative thoughts and beliefs about pain often lead to worsened emotional and social functioning and a decreased response to medical interventions for pain.\nFear of pain: Concern or worry about an injury drives avoidant or protective behaviours. The anticipation of an increased sensation of pain may limit you from engaging in physical activity or attending social outings. Pain-avoidant behaviours can lead to physical deconditioning and further decreased quality of life.\nPain acceptance: This is a challenging, but highly effective technique focused on developing an accepting attitude towards the pain. It involves doing your best to nonjudgmentally acknowledge the presence of pain and minimise unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that won‚Äôt make pain better.\nTrauma: The link between prior trauma and chronic pain is becoming better understood. Psychological therapies can address ongoing physical and emotional stress responses linked to traumatic experiences.","location":"The Psychology Practice","locationId":1304234999624574,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Dr Jade Kua","taggedUsername1":"drjadekua","taggedFullName2":"Expat Living Singapore","taggedUsername2":"expatlivingsg","taggedFullName3":"","taggedUsername3":"auspsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName4":"Psychology Today","taggedUsername4":"psych_today","taggedFullName5":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername5":"msfcares","taggedFullName6":"SG Psychological Society","taggedUsername6":"singaporepsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName7":"Health Promotion Board","taggedUsername7":"hpbsg","taggedFullName8":"Chen Yiming","taggedUsername8":"sgdrwellness","taggedFullName9":"The Psychology Practice","taggedUsername9":"thepsychpractice","taggedFullName10":"Vitacare Family Clinic","taggedUsername10":"vitacarefamily","taggedFullName11":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedUsername11":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedFullName12":"MentalHealthAwareness Workshop","taggedUsername12":"murdochsgmentalhealth","taggedFullName13":"Fitivate","taggedUsername13":"feel_fitivated","taggedFullName14":"Murdoch Singapore üá∏üá¨","taggedUsername14":"murdochsgp","taggedFullName15":"Harvard Health","taggedUsername15":"harvard_health","taggedFullName16":"Mentally-Healthy","taggedUsername16":"mentallyhealthyaustralia","taggedFullName17":"Singapore Medical Association","taggedUsername17":"sgartforhcw","taggedFullName18":"Ministry of Health, Singapore","taggedUsername18":"moh_singapore","taggedFullName19":"SPS Youth Wing","taggedUsername19":"spsyouthwing","taggedFullName20":"Project: It‚Äôll Be Alright","taggedUsername20":"itllbealright.sg","id":"2755782136420980963_5502248997","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:46:54.141Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CY7pXKcvO7w/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychpractice","username":"thepsychpractice","likeCount":16,"commentCount":1,"caption":"Photo by The Psychology Practice in The Psychology Practice with @nycsg, @expatlivingsg, @youthcorpssg, @auspsychologicalsociety, @psych_today, @msfcares, @singaporepsychologicalsociety, @hpbsg, @sgdrwellness, @thepsychpractice, @vitacarefamily, @psychoanalysis.sg, @murdochsgmentalhealth, @feel_fitivated, @murdochsgp, @parentingteensandtweens, @youthalliancesg, @parentingwith.moesg, @moh_singapore, and @spsyouthwing.

On Saturday (15 Jan), road rage got the best of a man in Kovan who allegedly punched another driver he was unhappy with. However, what if there‚Äôs a deeper issue in our midst?\n.\nIt‚Äôs been 2 years since COVID hit us‚Ä¶ We have had to tolerate and deal with harsh realities, increasing stress and frustrations in all walks of life. At the tail end of the 2021, when we think things are settling, we re-enter into the new year as though the emotional trauma was already resolved. OF COURSE NOT‚Ä¶ it is highly likely we do not let go of these emotional challenges as we re-engage with sending our children to school in the mornings, not giving way because we‚Äôve [not] had our way, and for many of us, coping with adjusting to new contexts like school and return to work fully vaxxed in 2022 (lest we lose our jobs) are just examples of the tip of the iceberg.\n.\nPsychologically speaking, these instances cause us to ‚Äòregress‚Äô [to psychologically become immature/childlike] and ‚Äòsublimate‚Äô [to convert disowned feelings into more socially acceptable means as justifiably unleashed on the road and other motorists]. There, you have road rage. Of course, we get to see other instances of rage being vented into other coping forms and styles but until we get a hang of our emotional concerns, individuals would be none the wiser.

Every year we try to keep your needs in mind, and that includes the individuals who are hurting and do not relate to the holiday cheer at all.\n.\nThe year-end season can be associated with loss, trauma, and severe emotional pain, which can remind of how uncomfortable and frequently inconsolable it can be. Hence, there is no amount of sugar-coating or positivity bullsh*t that can cover up the reality of life. Besides, the past two years has been absolutely dismal although we've made it this far!\n.\nHOLD ON! Before this might sound like a weird Christmas greeting that's gone nightmarishly wrong, we encourage you all to stay close to your loved ones, or at least stay safe in your most secure space. Cuddle up, watch some TV, or go occupy yourself with your favourite past time for a good moment [you know best]. If your TPP therapist goes on break, it doesn't mean that you're no longer thought of - On the contrary, you're always kept in mind and that also means understanding how you may feel when they are not present for the time being.\n.\nSo, do keep well, and we wish you a peaceful and secure year's end. - Love, TPP. xoxo\n.\n#considerpsychotherapy #psychology #practice #psychotherapy #therapy #assessment #supervision #group #plog #blog #psychodynamic #psychoanalysis #psychotherapist #psychologist #clinicalpsychologist #clinicalpsychology #counselling #counseling #counselor #counsellor #igers #igsg #igdaily #like #follow #singapore #asia \n.\n#beapartofthecommunity\n#yourneedsarekeptinmind\nThe Psychology Practice \n@thepsychpractice\nhttps://thepsychpractice.com","location":"The Psychology Practice","locationId":1304234999624574,"type":"Video","viewCount":148,"taggedFullName1":"Expat Living Singapore","taggedUsername1":"expatlivingsg","taggedFullName2":"Christmas Wonderland Singapore","taggedUsername2":"christmaswonderlandsg","taggedFullName3":"","taggedUsername3":"auspsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName4":"Psychology Today","taggedUsername4":"psych_today","taggedFullName5":"Ministry of Education (MOE)","taggedUsername5":"moesingapore","taggedFullName6":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername6":"msfcares","taggedFullName7":"SG Psychological Society","taggedUsername7":"singaporepsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName8":"Health Promotion Board","taggedUsername8":"hpbsg","taggedFullName9":"Chen Yiming","taggedUsername9":"sgdrwellness","taggedFullName10":"The Psychology Practice","taggedUsername10":"thepsychpractice","taggedFullName11":"Vitacare Family Clinic","taggedUsername11":"vitacarefamily","taggedFullName12":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedUsername12":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedFullName13":"MentalHealthAwareness Workshop","taggedUsername13":"murdochsgmentalhealth","taggedFullName14":"Fitivate","taggedUsername14":"feel_fitivated","taggedFullName15":"Murdoch Singapore üá∏üá¨","taggedUsername15":"murdochsgp","taggedFullName16":"Mentally-Healthy","taggedUsername16":"mentallyhealthyaustralia","taggedFullName17":"Parenting With You","taggedUsername17":"parentingwith.moesg","taggedFullName18":"Ministry of Health, Singapore","taggedUsername18":"moh_singapore","taggedFullName19":"SPS Youth Wing","taggedUsername19":"spsyouthwing","taggedFullName20":"Project: It‚Äôll Be Alright","taggedUsername20":"itllbealright.sg","id":"2727217328215228819_5502248997","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:46:57.378Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXWesihjwo0/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychpractice","username":"thepsychpractice","likeCount":7,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-12-11T18:53:13.000Z","description":"[Free E-book download] Project IBA's @itllbealright.sg very first E-book launch, It'll Be Alright features a compilation of mental well-being stories, ranging from personal experiences to mental health tips for youths, by youths.\n.\n40 Individuals, 1 Inspiring book: Each of them has endured through their ups and downs bravely to share with us their mental endeavors today. \n.\nAlso, hear what our professionals have to say.

So, don‚Äôt just ride the mindfulness trend, it‚Äôs just one aspect of psychological functioning. Furthermore, it‚Äôs an entirely different approach toward living that if just treated as an intervention, we might pay for it dearly with certain psychological consequences.\n.\nThe ability to observe one‚Äôs emotions is also touted as a major benefit of mindfulness, and for many of us, this is indeed true. Yet can it go too far? Can we become too distanced from our experience? Indeed we can. Britton (2019) reviews multiple studies showing connections between meditation training and blunted emotionality and even dissociation for some participants.\n.\nSometimes mindfulness practices are taught to help us overcome avoidance, as a way of ‚Äúbeing with‚Äù that which is difficult. Again, much of the time this can offer great benefit. However, the reality is that some people don‚Äôt struggle as much with avoidance but instead become preoccupied with their troubles. For such individuals, the instruction to stay with a challenging experience may not be beneficial and could even be counterproductive.\n.\nThere tends to be a ‚Äúmore is better‚Äù attitude among mindfulness practitioners, where the answer to whatever ails you can easily become ‚Äúpractice more mindfulness.‚Äù Britton (2019) reminds us of the importance of paying attention to the duration of practice and where there might be diminishing returns or even harmful effects. For instance, she reviews research suggesting that meditation may help sleep only up to a certain amount, after which it may actually make sleep more difficult.\n.\nFull article @psych_today @ https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifespan-perspectives/202108/the-limits-mindfulness\n.\n#considerpsychotherapy #psychology #practice #psychotherapy #therapy #assessment #supervision #group #plog #blog #psychodynamic #psychoanalysis #psychotherapist #psychologist #clinicalpsychologist #clinicalpsychology #counselling #counseling #counselor #counsellor #asia\n.\n#beapartofthecommunity \n#yourneedsarekeptinmind\nThe Psychology Practice \n@thepsychpractice\nhttps://thepsychpractice.com","location":"The Psychology Practice","locationId":1304234999624574,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Expat Living Singapore","taggedUsername1":"expatlivingsg","taggedFullName2":"","taggedUsername2":"auspsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName3":"Psychology Today","taggedUsername3":"psych_today","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"SG Psychological Society","taggedUsername5":"singaporepsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName6":"Health Promotion Board","taggedUsername6":"hpbsg","taggedFullName7":"Chen Yiming","taggedUsername7":"sgdrwellness","taggedFullName8":"The Psychology Practice","taggedUsername8":"thepsychpractice","taggedFullName9":"Vitacare Family Clinic","taggedUsername9":"vitacarefamily","taggedFullName10":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedUsername10":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedFullName11":"MentalHealthAwareness Workshop","taggedUsername11":"murdochsgmentalhealth","taggedFullName12":"Fitivate","taggedUsername12":"feel_fitivated","taggedFullName13":"Murdoch Singapore üá∏üá¨","taggedUsername13":"murdochsgp","taggedFullName14":"Mentally-Healthy","taggedUsername14":"mentallyhealthyaustralia","taggedFullName15":"Parenting With You","taggedUsername15":"parentingwith.moesg","taggedFullName16":"Ministry of Health, Singapore","taggedUsername16":"moh_singapore","taggedFullName17":"Mum Space","taggedUsername17":"mumspace.asia","taggedFullName18":"SPS Youth Wing","taggedUsername18":"spsyouthwing","taggedFullName19":"Project: It‚Äôll Be Alright","taggedUsername19":"itllbealright.sg","id":"2723884323143890188_5502248997","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:46:57.379Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXIS0WcvzGe/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/amkfsccommunityservices","username":"amkfsccommunityservices","likeCount":95,"commentCount":12,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-12-06T05:25:54.000Z","description":"Discover the memories, moments and milestones that got us through this anything-but-normal year!

I read the commentary by Dr Harry Tan and team on homelessness on 16 Nov, titled ‚ÄúHelping the homeless beyond putting a roof over their heads‚Äù and I am truly thankful for the partnerships we‚Äôd formed in the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) Network.\n\nOther than operating S3Ps, our PEERS partners go on regular night walks to befriend our rough sleeping friends. I join them and our MSF colleagues on these night walks and I‚Äôm grateful for the community of support we‚Äôd built up since the Network was formed.\n\nI also shared my views and MSF Singapore's approach toward rough sleeping in the ST Forum page today. We all can play a part in helping our rough sleeping friends. If you come across rough sleepers who may need support or shelter, please call the ComCare Hotline at 1800-222-0000 or email the PEERS Office at msf_peersoffice@msf.gov.sg.\n\nYou can read the commentary here: https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/helping-the-homeless-beyond-putting-a-roof-over-their-heads, \n\nAnd my forum letter here: https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-everyone-can-play-a-part-to-support-rough-sleepers\n\nTL;DR ‚Äì We all can help our rough sleeping friends! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n#EricCares #CaringNInclusive #RoughSleeping #Homelessness #PEERS #PEERSNetwork #MSFCares","location":"Faith Methodist Church, Singapore","locationId":2430238,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername1":"msfcares","taggedFullName2":"Faith Methodist Church","taggedUsername2":"faithmcsg","id":"2714773486185732034_197051779","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:46:59.944Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWp4ArdBzl4/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/esh_wari","username":"esh_wari","likeCount":3207,"commentCount":14,"caption":"Photo shared by Eswari Gunasagar on November 24, 2021 tagging @msfcares.

When and why should I bring my child to see a psychologist? What are the factors that I should look for to bring my child to a psychologist before it is too late?\n.\nAndrea: One key area of concern would be significant changes to their daily functioning or behaviour such as prolonged changes in their mood where they can be more withdrawn or irritable and when they are showing expressions of self-harm or suicidal ideation. Trust your parental instincts and do note that it is never too late to attend to a child and to offer them support.\n‚Ä¶\nQ10. If I need to bring my child to a therapist, how can I explain this to him?\n.\nAndrea: Depending on the age of the child, gently point out your concerns about their mental health and ask if they might like to speak to someone who can help. You may provide more information about what a psychologist or therapist does.\n.\nOne way would be to explain that when our bodies are not well. For example, when we display cold/flu symptoms, we see a doctor to help us feel better ‚Äì hence it would be the same when our mind/heart is not well. When we feel sad, anxious or angry a lot, therefore we see a psychologist or therapist to help us feel better. If the child is resistant to the idea, do not coerce them but continue offering them support while also encouraging them to get help.\n.\nRead the full interview @ https://story.mamahood.com.sg/understand-childs-psychology/\n.\n#considerpsychotherapy #psychology #practice #psychotherapy #therapy #assessment #supervision #group #plog #blog #psychodynamic #psychoanalysis #psychotherapist #psychologist #clinicalpsychologist #clinicalpsychology #counselling #counseling #counselor #counsellor #igers #igsg #igdaily #like #follow #singapore #asia\n.\n#beapartofthecommunity \n#yourneedsarekeptinmind\nThe Psychology Practice \n@thepsychpractice\nhttps://thepsychpractice.com","location":"The Psychology Practice","locationId":1304234999624574,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Expat Living Singapore","taggedUsername1":"expatlivingsg","taggedFullName2":"Young Parents","taggedUsername2":"youngparents_sg","taggedFullName3":"Mothercare Singapore","taggedUsername3":"mothercaresg","taggedFullName4":"","taggedUsername4":"auspsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName5":"Psychology Today","taggedUsername5":"psych_today","taggedFullName6":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername6":"msfcares","taggedFullName7":"SG Psychological Society","taggedUsername7":"singaporepsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName8":"Health Promotion Board","taggedUsername8":"hpbsg","taggedFullName9":"Mamahood Singapore","taggedUsername9":"mamahood.com.sg","taggedFullName10":"Chen Yiming","taggedUsername10":"sgdrwellness","taggedFullName11":"The Psychology Practice","taggedUsername11":"thepsychpractice","taggedFullName12":"Vitacare Family Clinic","taggedUsername12":"vitacarefamily","taggedFullName13":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedUsername13":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedFullName14":"Fitivate","taggedUsername14":"feel_fitivated","taggedFullName15":"The Bowlby Centre","taggedUsername15":"thebowlbycentre","taggedFullName16":"Parenting With You","taggedUsername16":"parentingwith.moesg","taggedFullName17":"Ministry of Health, Singapore","taggedUsername17":"moh_singapore","taggedFullName18":"Mum Space","taggedUsername18":"mumspace.asia","taggedFullName19":"SPS Youth Wing","taggedUsername19":"spsyouthwing","id":"2707356502011438884_5502248997","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:46:59.944Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWPlt-7J2ET/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/theekthak_siwec","username":"theekthak_siwec","likeCount":9,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo shared by TheekThak /‡®†‡©Ä‡®ï ‡®†‡®æ‡®ï/Are you ok? on November 13, 2021 tagging @mysinda, @ncss.sg, @msfcares, @sos.org.sg, @mental_act_sg, @mindline.sg, @instituteofmentalhealth_, and @siwec.sg.","pubDate":"2021-11-14T04:54:20.000Z","description":"Help is at hand, no matter what you may be experiencing and how hard it may seem.

For instance, a survey found that 85% of participants aged 18 to 24 were dissatisfied with their body (Baker, 2018). From 2016 to 2020, there was an average of 300 patients per year who received treatment for various eating disorders from Singaporean public hospitals, with a median patient age of 21 years old (Khan, 2021). Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which is one of the few hospitals in Singapore with a multidisciplinary and specialised team for treating EDs, also sees patients who usually present symptoms between 17 to 22 years old (Baker, 2018).\n.\nDespite an increase in global prevalence of Eating Disorders, there is little conversation and awareness surrounding this issue, especially among peers of the tertiary age group. In collaboration with @nus_singapore students, TPP Clinical Psychologist Ms. Lynette Tan was interviewed for her professional views. This ebook will help raise awareness about ED and normalise discussions about mental wellness, body image, and developing a healthy relationship with food and exercise.\n.\nAccess the E-book now to learn more!

You might find this to be quite an illuminating article. We suggest this article to leaders and Human Resources of your organisation, as a psychological way of understanding employee dynamics. Perhaps an organisational psychologist might be useful as a consideration for your business.\n.\nHere‚Äôs some highlights:\n‚Ä¢ People high in narcissism seem to have considerable success in many domains in life, including at work‚Äîfor example, they get promoted fast.\n‚Ä¢ Narcissistic employees‚Äô promotability may be due to their impression management skills and, especially, their displays of power.\n‚Ä¢ Using the same techniques narcissists employ, such as displaying more power, may help non-narcissistic employees get the promotions they deserve.\n.\n‚ÄúIn general, making promotability assessments is more difficult than many other types of assessments (e.g., performance review). Why? Because promotability assessments are based less on concrete information regarding an employee‚Äôs success on a particular project and more on intangible qualities, like cues of future potential. These cues, of course, include displays of power, something narcissists tend to know how to do very well.‚Äù\n.\nVia @psych_today\n.\n#considerpsychotherapy #psychology #practice #psychotherapy #therapy #assessment #supervision #group #plog #blog #psychodynamic #psychoanalysis #psychotherapist #psychologist #clinicalpsychologist #clinicalpsychology #counselling #counseling #counselor #counsellor #igers #igsg #igdaily #like #follow #singapore #asia\n.\n#beapartofthecommunity \n#yourneedsarekeptinmind\nThe Psychology Practice \n@thepsychpractice\nhttps://thepsychpractice.com","location":"The Psychology Practice","locationId":1304234999624574,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Expat Living Singapore","taggedUsername1":"expatlivingsg","taggedFullName2":"","taggedUsername2":"auspsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName3":"Psychology Today","taggedUsername3":"psych_today","taggedFullName4":"Ministry of Education (MOE)","taggedUsername4":"moesingapore","taggedFullName5":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername5":"msfcares","taggedFullName6":"SG Psychological Society","taggedUsername6":"singaporepsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName7":"Health Promotion Board","taggedUsername7":"hpbsg","taggedFullName8":"Chen Yiming","taggedUsername8":"sgdrwellness","taggedFullName9":"The Psychology Practice","taggedUsername9":"thepsychpractice","taggedFullName10":"Vitacare Family Clinic","taggedUsername10":"vitacarefamily","taggedFullName11":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedUsername11":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedFullName12":"MentalHealthAwareness Workshop","taggedUsername12":"murdochsgmentalhealth","taggedFullName13":"Fitivate","taggedUsername13":"feel_fitivated","taggedFullName14":"Murdoch Singapore üá∏üá¨","taggedUsername14":"murdochsgp","taggedFullName15":"Mental ACT","taggedUsername15":"mental_act_sg","taggedFullName16":"Mental Health Collective SG","taggedUsername16":"mentalhealthcollectivesg","taggedFullName17":"Ministry of Health, Singapore","taggedUsername17":"moh_singapore","taggedFullName18":"Project Green Ribbon SG üá∏üá¨","taggedUsername18":"projectgreenribbonsg","taggedFullName19":"SPS Youth Wing","taggedUsername19":"spsyouthwing","id":"2699859793904228195_5502248997","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:01.212Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVxQN2cPcNg/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychpractice","username":"thepsychpractice","likeCount":37,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-11-02T10:09:14.000Z","description":"[how does childhood emotional injustice affect your adult behaviour?] Ever wondered why psychologists keep harping on what happened to you in your earlier days?

When Ruckstaetter started researching apologies in graduate school, he found perplexingly few studies focusing on apologies from parents to children. For his doctoral dissertation, he surveyed 327 parents and found that those who regularly apologised to their children reported stronger attachment bonds.\n.\nYes, parents need to display a remorse and take charge of their own responses. When you show that your apology is unconditional (meaning that you don‚Äôt make them pay in your next sentence), they learn from your display and know that it‚Äôs possible to take that stance. This teaches them about humility, pride and that apologies can mend relational problems and increase intimacy!

She shares about how she first met her ex-husband, how they fell in love and out of it. It all started when her honeymoon turned into a \"horror-moon\" and due to a series of events, the verbal outbursts gradually led to physical violence. Over time, she learnt to open up to her family and friends about her situation and with their help, managed to escape her narcissistic ex-husband, leaving him for good. We hope that Zionette's story can help those who are facing similar situations to have the courage to do what is right by them. \n\nIf you are reading this and feel like you can relate to it and you need someone to talk to, do not hesitate to drop us a DM. ‚ù§\n\n#amillennialmess #millennial #mess #messy #lifeismessy #girls #newpodcast #podcast #sgpodcast #supportlocal #singaporepodcast #sgpodcast #deniecegrace #jadekerr #navigatelife #girltalk #zionetteesther #youtubesinger #contentcreator #bloomr #abuse #tw #triggerwarning #mentalhealth #horrormoon #verbalabuse #physicalabuse #narcissist #narcissisticabuse","location":"Singapore","locationId":105565836144069,"type":"Video","viewCount":252,"taggedFullName1":"Zionette | YouTube Singer","taggedUsername1":"zionetteesther","taggedFullName2":"Jade Kerr|Singer|Vocal Coach","taggedUsername2":"jade.kerr","taggedFullName3":"Deniece | Performing Artist","taggedUsername3":"deniecefoo","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"Bloomr.SG","taggedUsername5":"bloomr.sg","id":"2683332086622158919_45464739202","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:02.747Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CU6xHXPBJkZ/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/daughtersoftomorrow","username":"daughtersoftomorrow","likeCount":124,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-10-12T06:18:29.000Z","description":"What are the implications of clashing working and childcare hours for mothers? üë©‚Äçüëß\n\nSwipe right to find out why it's so important for mothers to have adequate childcare support in order to sustain their livelihoods. \n\n#InternationalDayForTheEradicationOfPoverty #empoweringwomen #enablingfamilies #transforminglives #communitysupport #childcaresupport #workingmothers","location":"Singapore","locationId":105565836144069,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"United Nations","taggedUsername1":"unitednations","taggedFullName2":"AWARE Singapore","taggedUsername2":"awaresingapore","taggedFullName3":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername3":"msfcares","id":"2682672538315954457_3962903522","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:02.747Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CU6P4LxB1kw/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychpractice","username":"thepsychpractice","likeCount":17,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-10-12T01:28:03.000Z","description":"[worried about your mental health?] What should you look out for in general that could be suggesting you need some assistance or support?

Moreover, studies show they also have higher self-esteem, greater empathy for others, are more trusting and cooperative and, as a consequence, others are more open to trusting and cooperating with them. In other words, social connectedness generates a positive feedback loop of social, emotional and physical well-being.\n.\nUnfotunately, the opposite is also true for those who lack social connectedness. Low levels of social connection are associated with declines in physical and psychological health as well as a higher likelihood for antisocial behavior that leads to further isolation.

Either way, it‚Äôs good news people are beginning to care about their own backyard and feel their personal issues are legitimate.

Strap in for the long-term, because the responsibility of self-care falls on (you guessed it!) yourSELF, and not on your organisation.

Youths often face long days at school, hours of homework, and are then pushed by parents to have private tuition. This creates an impact on mental wellbeing, with rising numbers seeking psychiatric help as they struggle to cope with the relentless pressure for academic excellence.\n\nStatistics by the Samaritans of Singapore show that suicide is the leading cause of death for those aged 10 to 29 with 452 lives lost to suicide in 2020 alone. This includes a 37.5 per cent increase from 2019 for the age group of 10 to 19. Education Minister, Mr Chan Chun Sing, has also acknowledged that the overall increase in suicides in young people this year have been due to the Covid-19 pandemic aggravating existing stressors.

This is the fuel of what continues conversion therapy and the movement more generally into the present day, despite the undeniable evidence that it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîand that it causes trauma.\n.\nRead the full article via @time @ https://time.com/6088170/pray-away-documentary/\n.\n#considerpsychotherapy #psychology #practice #psychotherapy #therapy #assessment #supervision #group #plog #blog #psychodynamic #psychoanalysis #psychotherapist #psychologist #clinicalpsychologist #clinicalpsychology #counselling #counseling #counselor #counsellor #igers #igsg #igdaily #like #follow #singapore #asia\n.\n#beapartofthecommunity \n#yourneedsarekeptinmind\nThe Psychology Practice \n@thepsychpractice\nhttps://thepsychpractice.com","location":"The Psychology Practice","locationId":1304234999624574,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"TIME","taggedUsername1":"time","taggedFullName2":"Pink Dot SG","taggedUsername2":"pinkdotsg","taggedFullName3":"","taggedUsername3":"auspsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName4":"Psychology Today","taggedUsername4":"psych_today","taggedFullName5":"Ministry of Education (MOE)","taggedUsername5":"moesingapore","taggedFullName6":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername6":"msfcares","taggedFullName7":"SG Psychological Society","taggedUsername7":"singaporepsychologicalsociety","taggedFullName8":"Netflix Singapore","taggedUsername8":"netflixsg","taggedFullName9":"Health Promotion Board","taggedUsername9":"hpbsg","taggedFullName10":"The Psychology Practice","taggedUsername10":"thepsychpractice","taggedFullName11":"LGBT SG +65 üá∏üá¨üåà‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíöüíôüíúüåà","taggedUsername11":"sg_lgbt_community","taggedFullName12":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedUsername12":"psychoanalysis.sg","taggedFullName13":"SG Psych Stuff","taggedUsername13":"sgpsychstuff","taggedFullName14":"MentalHealthAwareness Workshop","taggedUsername14":"murdochsgmentalhealth","taggedFullName15":"Murdoch Singapore üá∏üá¨","taggedUsername15":"murdochsgp","taggedFullName16":"LGBT YouthSG","taggedUsername16":"lgbtyouthsg","taggedFullName17":"LGBT","taggedUsername17":"lgbt","taggedFullName18":"LGBTQ+","taggedUsername18":"lgbtq","taggedFullName19":"Ministry of Health, Singapore","taggedUsername19":"moh_singapore","taggedFullName20":"SPS Youth Wing","taggedUsername20":"spsyouthwing","id":"2637591851397616019_5502248997","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:06.736Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CSYYb28nYip/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/belandbray","username":"belandbray","likeCount":268,"commentCount":130,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-08-10T04:45:51.000Z","description":"Still in some Red & White mood like us? ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nWhy not bake some cookies with the family with the National Day Cookie Kit? üá∏üá¨üç™ ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nWe had great fun mixing up and kneading the dough, burnt some cookies along the way but yielded really yummy ones the kiddos can't stop eating until my last warning ü§£ it's either they will both end up with sore throat or we have no more left to decorate!

Students prefer their teachers to counsellors for mental health support but ‚Äòteacher-counsellors‚Äô is NOT a good idea. Why do we say that? Let‚Äôs see.\n.\nThe role of a teacher and the role of a counsellor are unique and significant in the way one operates in a school. In order for a teacher to be effective, they need to provide instruction, whilst being emotionally accessible to their students as it helps with interpersonal connection. However, counsellors are therapists and have a very different professional relationship with their clients. For counsellors to be effective for their clients, they are required to exercise good boundaries and have limited contact in the scope of the goals of counselling. Hence, by lumping these two significantly different roles essentially muddles up the role of a teacher or counsellor, thereby inhibiting the effectiveness of either role. Coupled with the added stress of needing to train to be an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù counsellor, whilst being a competent teacher, we may have introduced an insurmountable layer of psychological stress for the teacher needing to play multiple roles over and above an already stressful occupation, despite news of reducing their workload. It‚Äôs like telling a mother or father that they need to take on the role of their spouse in addition to their current role ‚Äî is it possible to lessen one‚Äôs workload to mitigate the stressful situation?

It makes me chuckle a little when someone praises my husband for being so hands-on. Sure appreciation is merited but not because he is helping me out but because he is fulfilling his responsibility to equally care for the baby and our home. I understand where this old school thinking is coming from but a lot has changed since then and perspectives should too. \n\nIt‚Äôs an obsolete concept where moms are considered the primary caregiver unless the couple has decided for one of them to be a stay-at-home parent, I say parent because it can either be the mom or the dad. In our case, I feel my husband is better suited to be a SAHD if given the choice because he is more patient and a homebody. \n\nI see mixed feedback where other fathers are happily doing their part with this equal parenting while some can do more. And that‚Äôs okay because parenting is a learning journey. No one is perfect and that transcends to being a parent. Parenthood is tough but what matters is the love, care and attention we put in for our child, our spouse and the family in totality.\n\nSo thank you @neoquadra for being an awesome dad. We love you and hope you never get tired of feeding, bathing, caring, playing, talking and reading books to our son, @howisethan. Like I mentioned to you during his first week of existence, you are doing great! \n\nAppreciating and celebrating all the fathers and father figures out there because they deserve it too!\n\nCurious!

I like to think it‚Äôs because we all need a bit of rescuing from time to time. Whether you were bullied at the playground or workplace, or experienced extremes of severe trauma in your life, we had all encountered ordeals where we wished we had been rescued. But superheroes need rescuing too - they face grief, personal tragedies, moral dilemmas and no-win scenarios - but they also show us how we can cope in the face of insurmountable odds. \n\nI am no superhero, despite the hashtag #docbydaysuperherobynight I wish I were - but no amount of gamma radiation, or superhuman serum, is going to turn me into one. I use humour as my \"superpower\" though - as I firmly believe that laughter is the best medicine. \n\nBut trauma is no laughing matter.\n\nI recently learnt that two-thirds of people in Singapore have experienced at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives, and that in 2020, @msfcares handled significantly more child abuse cases compared to the preceding 6 years. Growing up with considerable trauma can cause them to project these negative emotions into their own actions - most times at a subconscious level. It is thus on us as a caring society to be aware of these trauma and how it can impact on the community‚Äôs mental health. We must better identify the at-risk population by being more trauma-informed, in order to provide support to these victims, or to direct them to seek professional help.\n\nRemember. Clowns cry too, and sometimes the widest grins can hide the saddest tears. These persons could be anyone around you. And it might even be you. \n\n@SafeCircle.SG (https://www.safecircle.sg ) comprises 7 local agencies that focus on community-based mental health services for children and youths. The platform provides help in coping with trauma, and also equips us with the resources to offer help to someone in need. As a parent, educator, helping professional or even just a concerned peer, check out their complimentary programs and workshops to integrate trauma-informed care into our work and lives. \n\n#SafeCircleSG","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Jace Ang","taggedUsername1":"jaceangmakeup","taggedFullName2":"Tjin Lee","taggedUsername2":"tjinlee","taggedFullName3":"Rennie üçã","taggedUsername3":"reexnee","taggedFullName4":"Mercury Social","taggedUsername4":"mercurysocial","taggedFullName5":"doc.adrian","taggedUsername5":"doc.adrian","taggedFullName6":"Singapore Children's Society","taggedUsername6":"sgchildrensoc","taggedFullName7":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername7":"msfcares","taggedFullName8":"Limitless","taggedUsername8":"we.are.limitless","taggedFullName9":"SAMH","taggedUsername9":"samhsingapore","taggedFullName10":"Acceset","taggedUsername10":"accesets","taggedFullName11":"Caregivers Alliance Limited","taggedUsername11":"calsingapore","taggedFullName12":"Campus PSY","taggedUsername12":"campuspsy.sg","taggedFullName13":"Boys' Town","taggedUsername13":"boystownsg","taggedFullName14":"Safe Circle","taggedUsername14":"safecircle.sg","id":"2621157762290967362_1530118307","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:09.913Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRfgB9NHT-l/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychpractice","username":"thepsychpractice","likeCount":14,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo by The Psychology Practice in The Psychology Practice with @thenewpaper, @todayonline, @channelnewsasia, @straits_times, @expatlivingsg, @psychoanalysis_, @auspsychologicalsociety, @nytimes, @psych_today, @moesingapore, @msfcares, @singaporepsychologicalsociety, @cnainsider, @sgdrwellness, @thepsychpractice, @vitacarefamily, @psychoanalysis.sg, @feel_fitivated, @psychoanalysis4all, and @moh_singapore.

It is also worrying to read that in 2020, @msfcares handled 44.6% more child abuse cases compared to 6 years before. \n\nGrowing up with trauma can cause victims to project their trauma unto their actions. Hence, it is important for us as a society to be aware of trauma and how it relates to mental health. Being more trauma-informed, we can then better identify the vulnerable population, provide support and care to distressed victims, or encourage them to seek professional help if needed. \n\n@SafeCircle.SG (https://www.safecircle.sg ) comprises 7 local agencies that focus on community-based mental health services for children and youths. The platform provides help in coping with trauma, and also equips us with the resources to offer help to someone in need. As a parent, educator, helping professional or even just a concerned peer, check out their complimentary programs and workshops to integrate trauma-informed care into our work and lives. \n\n#SafeCircleSG #mentalhealth #psychologicalhealth #emotionalhealth #mentalhealthsupport #mentalwellness #mentalwellbeing #emotionalwellness #trauma #mentaltrauma #psychologicaltrauma #childhoodtrauma #adversechildhoodexperiences #childabuse #traumainformed #traumainformedcare #traumaawareness #traumahealing #selfcare #feelsafe #peersupport #helpinghand\n\n@accesets @boystownsg @campuspsy.sg @calsingapore @we.are.limitless @samhsingapore @sgchildrensoc @mercurysocial","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Jace Ang","taggedUsername1":"jaceangmakeup","taggedFullName2":"Mercury Social","taggedUsername2":"mercurysocial","taggedFullName3":"Singapore Children's Society","taggedUsername3":"sgchildrensoc","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"Limitless","taggedUsername5":"we.are.limitless","taggedFullName6":"SAMH","taggedUsername6":"samhsingapore","taggedFullName7":"Acceset","taggedUsername7":"accesets","taggedFullName8":"Caregivers Alliance Limited","taggedUsername8":"calsingapore","taggedFullName9":"Campus PSY","taggedUsername9":"campuspsy.sg","taggedFullName10":"Boys' Town","taggedUsername10":"boystownsg","taggedFullName11":"Safe Circle","taggedUsername11":"safecircle.sg","id":"2620890249447707166_1527794142","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:09.914Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZGfhPnMWs/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychpractice","username":"thepsychpractice","likeCount":24,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-07-16T15:24:28.000Z","description":"[ANGER management? We need it from early on] Don‚Äôt teach your child NOT to be angry ‚Äî Teach them HOW to be angry.\n.\nLet‚Äôs not deceive ourselves parents! Learning to manage our feelings start from early on as developmentally age-appropriate milestones. Anger is just one of the many feelings we have that is necessary for our aggressive manifestations necessary for behavioural regulation and the building blocks for learning assertiveness. If we are afraid to deal with our own anger or express it in a useful way, it is almost inevitable that our children will struggle with being able to do so. Guess where they would have internalised these emotional regulation dynamics from? So, let‚Äôs start from the beginning. By showing our children how they can express their anger confidently and communicatively, it will help them in ways that pay exponential dividends psychologically and interpersonally. Don‚Äôt squander it away by discouraging their display of anger or worse, to suppress or ‚Äògaslight‚Äô their incendiary experiences. Remember, suppressed emotions will always come back in uglier ways.

Instead, they can think about how the wedding can be conducted in a way that is more representative of who they are or even consider personalising the experience for their guests, which may be hard to do on a larger scale. ‚ÄòSmaller scale‚Äô does not mean it has to be any less memorable.‚Äù\n.\nKEEP CALM AND MARRY ON!\nIf you are disappointed and/or frustrated with changes to your wedding plans, Ms Lynette Tan suggests that you tune in to how you feel, and be kind to yourself and your partner. Also, it is vital to talk it out ‚Äî after all, the pandemic can understandably lead to worries such as financial security, or starting a family. Find an appropriate time to have conversations about these issues. When your partner shares his or her feelings, respond gently.

One can conceptualise the therapeutic relationship as a mental representation of how we learn to resolve our interpersonal and psychological relationships with others. This is a crucial element in the way we advocate for the healing of attachment injuries, since many of our clients had devastating experiences separating and individuating from others in their lives ‚Äî this interplay extends from the time we spend in our mother‚Äôs womb to when we enter our tomb.

It‚Äôs easier to attack or witness wrongdoing in another person than confront that possibility in one's own behavior.

Psychologically, it is crucial in our early development that we can distinguish another parent that is separate from our mothers. This duality allows us to form specific relations that we internalise as ways to understand ourselves and being with other people. Thus, no one can replace the crucial role a father plays in forming a paternal object that is sufficiently safe and gratifying in a child‚Äôs mind ‚Äî so that the child can tolerate being away from the secure confines of their mothers. In many instances big and small, it matters how our children experience their fathers and relations with men, including their attitudes toward their kids regardless of age. If you‚Äôre a Dad, it‚Äôs such a privilege to be able to play that role but we acknowledge, is one of the most important roles in your child‚Äôs life that will be deeply influencing for the rest of their lives. This is especially when we can exist in a context where sexist and toxic masculinity undertones are embraced.

Ah Pui's culinary contributions to our community as an individual are significant - satiating tummies, building our heritage, and inspiring others to soldier on amidst adversity.\n\nIn our fast-paced, hyperconnected society where achievements, success, and cash are often our kings, Ah Pui embodies an underdog story. A divorcee residing in public rental housing and a recipient of MSF ComCare assistance, Ah Pui is one of the 'invisibles' in Singapore. But despite circumstances, he remains resilient, and adamant in the pursuit of a better future.\n\nAt our core, 195PHC is a community F&B incubator - and in our time with Ah Pui, we have convinced him to 'go legal', think bigger, and embrace possibilities. Ah Pui has since found an independent angel investor who has already set up a company with him to take his satay offerings to the next level - and we eagerly await updates!\n\nTwo questions on everyone's minds: \n\n1) Whither the satay? Ah Pui has very kindly gifted the cafe with the full recipe for the satay and sauce, and has passed on the entirety of his skillsets to Ben - so it's business as usual for us as we continue churning out the sticks of indulgent delight!\n\n2) Whither the cafe? Alongside our current F&B offerings which will remain unchanged, we will be bringing in new ones when Phase 2 (HA) concludes. These will continue to build on 195PHC's role as a community incubator.\n\nThank you Ah Pui - for your contributions, resolve, skills, and satay. While you will be missed dearly, we know The Best is Yet to Be.\n\n#hawkerfoodsg #unesco #sgigfoodies #sg #sgfoodie #sgfood #fatdieme #tiongbahru #satayman #hawkersg #xieÃÇn #skewers #bbq #‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏õ‡∏¥‡πâ‡∏á #‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πä‡∏∞ #yakitori #Êñ∞Âä†Âù° #Ê≤ôÁàπ #·Ñä·Ö°·Ü∑·Ñå·Ö°·Üº #singapore #visitsingapore #makan #makansg #sgfooddiary #travelogue #musttry #streetfood #lasthawker #supportlocalsg #„Éè„Çô„Éº„Éò„Çô„Ç≠„É•„Éº","location":"195 Pearl's Hill Terrace","locationId":432053770929646,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername1":"msfcares","taggedFullName2":"Rickshaw Coffee","taggedUsername2":"rickshaw_coffee","taggedFullName3":"The Attic Fox","taggedUsername3":"atticfoxsg","taggedFullName4":"Chef L","taggedUsername4":"chefl_195phc","id":"2576788520171292385_4793088495","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:18.226Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPAzRaUH72u/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/freyaguide","username":"freyaguide","likeCount":3,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo by FreyaGuide in Singapore with @msfcares.

While we don‚Äôt always agree, our key to resolution is to always listen ‚Äî it may not happen instantly, especially when tempers flare, but deep in our hearts we know we want to work towards that goal and so on our own we‚Äôll find our way there. Once we‚Äôre calm, we can then have a proper conversation. \n\nFor some couples, it can be hard to be objective and take a step back when tensions mount. That‚Äôs why the Ministry of Social and Family Development @msfcares has partnered with Community Psychology Hub (CPH) to provide online counselling service for those who may be facing marital and parenting stress. It‚Äôs completely free-of-charge and allows for anonymous sign ups.

The homeless reportedly face health issues and dangers such as theft, and were often often approached and questioned by law enforcement agencies. Homelessness has been a serious and rising issue in Singapore for the past few years yet, are we doing enough for them?\n\nThe Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) safe, sound sleeping places, run by 35 organisations that are existing or potential partners of the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (Peers) Network, was launched in July 2019. It mainly aims to help and take care of the homeless in Singapore by providing 700 spaces of safe shelters for them. Apart from providing shelters, a daily $15 food allowance is given and also, befrienders will continue to keep in touch with them through calls and texts. \n\nShould you see anyone in need of shelter, you can reach out to msf_peersoffice@msf.gov.sg or call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000.\n\n#bloomproject #awarenesspostseries #awarenesspost #awareness #homelessness #helpthehomeless #homeless #singaporepoly","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Singapore Polytechnic","taggedUsername1":"singaporepoly","taggedFullName2":"CommunityService&CulturalClub","taggedUsername2":"spcscc","taggedFullName3":"SP Dept of Student Development","taggedUsername3":"lifeatsp","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"SP Peer Support Club","taggedUsername5":"sp.peersupporters","taggedFullName6":"Homeless Hearts of Singapore","taggedUsername6":"homelesssg","id":"2534912906282633772_24973214029","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:21.581Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMrOsyhJHno/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/walkinvegas","username":"walkinvegas","likeCount":133,"commentCount":22,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-03-21T09:17:59.000Z","description":"Assalamualaikum everyone!

With 2021 declared by @msfcares as the year of #CelebratingSGWomen, we want to recognise all women who have given their all both for their family and the wider society. \n\nChrystella and Samantha are two out of many #LadiesWhoLead at HCSA. Chrystella wasn‚Äôt sure where her career path would lead, but it was during a mission trip to China when she felt called to pursue a Masters in Counselling. \n\nOn the other hand, Samantha had made her mind up at a young age that she wanted to work in the social service sector. Even though their initial goals were worlds apart, their paths eventually converged. \n\n‚ÄúAlthough the social service industry is women-dominated, there are many ladies, like our beneficiaries, who are less privileged and not as fortunate to be able to choose. That‚Äôs why IWD matters to all of us,‚Äù said Samantha. \n\n‚ÄúI think International Women‚Äôs Day is about celebrating women and our unique contributions. More women are in the workforce now, and most of them are still family-oriented too. \n\n‚ÄúDRTC staff comprises mostly women and I value the relationships that we have. It spurs us to give our best in our work, for our beneficiaries. We even had to say: ‚ÄúGuys, we can't hang out so much due to COVID-19,‚Äô‚Äù Chrystella said. \n\n‚ÄúThe late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said that of his two concerns ‚Äì country and family ‚Äì he looked after the former while his wife cared for the latter. The impact of his wife's contribution really stuck with me,‚Äù Samantha added. \n\nTo all #LadiesWhoLead both at work and at home, thank you for your contributions! üëè","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername1":"msfcares","taggedFullName2":"NVPC - Towards a City of Good","taggedUsername2":"cityofgoodsg","id":"2524602073993955557_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:23.302Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMI21XQHoKU/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/sportcares","username":"sportcares","likeCount":74,"commentCount":2,"caption":"Photo shared by SportCares on March 07, 2021 tagging @_.snbmk, @msfcares, @internationalwomensday_global, and @snl_dwugirls.","pubDate":"2021-03-08T00:55:16.000Z","description":"SportCares celebrates our girls and women this International Women‚Äôs Day‚ú®\n\nWhat do you #ChooseToChallenge for girls and women? \n\n#IWD\n#IWD2021\n#girlpower\n#playlikeagirl\n#womensupportwomen\n#CommunitiesofCare\n#SportCares\n#changinglivesthroughsport","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"","taggedUsername1":"_.snbmk","taggedFullName2":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername2":"msfcares","taggedFullName3":"International Women's Day","taggedUsername3":"internationalwomensday_global","taggedFullName4":"District West United Girls","taggedUsername4":"snl_dwugirls","id":"2524508752751526548_1497021691","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:23.302Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMIwNMoDJ-h/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/soka.singapore","username":"soka.singapore","likeCount":520,"commentCount":1,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-03-07T23:57:21.000Z","description":"Happy International Women's Day to all women of Soka ‚Äì the magnificent suns of happiness! \n.\nPresident Ikeda writes, ‚ÄúAround the globe, women who uphold the Mystic Law are creating and spreading tremendous joy as they strive to realize peace and happiness for all.

She is always keeping a keen eye out for business ventures and giving us tips and advice, to take our business to the next level. I‚Äôve always had great admiration for her as she is able to juggle so many things on her plate every day, especially now that I‚Äôm older and have taken over the family business.\n\nWomen are now increasingly being featured in magazines or news publications, and I applaud their great achievements. I find it heartening that they are making waves even in industries that are believed to be male-dominated. It just shows how far we have progressed in our economy and society as a whole. But we have some way to go to educate the masses that the worth of each individual is not dependent on gender.\n\nSo let's look forward to greater progress for our women.\n\nDo you too have a woman in life that you look up to or have always admired?

I‚Äôd pick her up and we‚Äôd go for dinner and talk about our future together. That was our version of dates. And I‚Äôm there for her when she needs me. Even when we were just friends, I'd offer to accompany her parents to their medical visits.\n\nShe says that I‚Äôm an easy-going guy, and that the past is the past.

She made me believe that women are capable of anything & have the power to run the world only because I grew up watching her possess  immense confidence and strong will!  I have seen my mother fight through all the odds. She never once gave up. Even when times were tough for us financially... she always found a way to provide us the best.  I remember my mother, waking up as early as 4am to head to work. She did odd jobs, just so she can lighten the financial situation at home. She would then come back home and still cook and take care of us .. no matter how tired she was.  Her job required her to be always on the move.. she would come back home with her feet aching. She would soak her legs in warm water for a little while and then she will get back up .. just to attend to us.  She is kind, gentle yet so determined to provide the best for her family.

But perhaps the one that stands out the most is her strong sense of faith and trust even when things aren‚Äôt smooth sailing. Even when the odds weren‚Äôt in her favour. \n\nIn her early primary school days, she struggled with stuttering and that made it hard for her to find her voice... And so she turned to the voice within. Through penning down her thoughts (and so beautifully so I may say), she found an avenue to express herself. \n\nWhile it‚Äôs a rough scene for novelists/journalists in Singapore, she found a middle ground in PR where she could still delve in writing but in a more commercial manner. On the sidelines, writing still remains an outlet for her to introspect and reflect on pinnacle moments in her life. With her archive growing, she indirectly prepares to share her work with the world someday.\n\nBut I guess what inspires me the most, is how she always comes back to writing. That flame that burns so brightly in spite it all, as something that keeps her grounded and more importantly, alive. \n\nAnd to that, I‚Äôd like to say, thank you for daring to dream and I can‚Äôt wait for the day your dream comes to fruition. x\n\nCoda, This Room And The Next, and When Maps Fail by Liane Seow. \n‚Ä¢\nJoin me in celebrating the women who dare to dream by taking part in the Conversations on Singapore Women‚Äôs Development at go.gov.sg/sgwomen.

I can't thank her enough for looking after us all these years, and always being there for us, as our elder sister \n\nThis year, join me in celebrating SG Women and show gratitude and appreciation for all the wonderful women in your life! üß°\n\nLet‚Äôs take part in the Conversations on Singapore Women‚Äôs Development at go.gov.sg/sgwomen, and build a better, more inclusive society.  #CelebratingSGWomen @msfcares","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername1":"msfcares","id":"2506008248408963105_14328606199","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:25.597Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLHC8UDr7Gb/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hannahalkaff","username":"hannahalkaff","likeCount":1117,"commentCount":7,"caption":"Photo shared by Hannah Alkaff on February 10, 2021 tagging @iicyess, and @msfcares.","pubDate":"2021-02-10T11:31:12.000Z","description":"\"there is no force more powerful than a woman determined to rise\" \nfor many years, she spent her weekdays at school & weekends at work, while making sure she achieves good grades  and helps out in her family‚Äôs business at the same time. now that she's done with school, she works full-time on the business, making use of all that she acquired in her business degree course to take her already successful Thai restaurant to even greater heights. the hard work and dedication she puts into anything and everything she does is truly admirable, and she‚Äôs definitely one i don't want to lose. \ni am honoured to have grown with you over the past 5 years, ice. i can't wait to continue growing with you as we both work to achieve our dreams togetherü§ç‚ú®\n2021 is the year we Celebrate SG Women, so let us all come together to achieve an even more inclusive society and take part in the Conversations on Singapore Women's Development at go.gov.sg/sgwomen  #CelebratingSGWomen @msfcares","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Simachat Chomprach","taggedUsername1":"iicyess","taggedFullName2":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername2":"msfcares","id":"2505984658453279131_176351242","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:25.597Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLD4tkEncL7/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/daughtersoftomorrow","username":"daughtersoftomorrow","likeCount":123,"commentCount":1,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-02-09T06:04:05.000Z","description":"As part of celebrating SG Women 2021 with The Straits Times, Kim Underhill, President of DOT was featured as one of the pioneering Singapore women who have redefined success in her own way.

One incident I remember vividly was when her close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer. She stood by her throughout, keeping her company, and running her day-to-day errands. Most importantly, she was a great pillar of emotional support, making it a point to let her friend know that she‚Äôll always be there to listen. She encouraged her to stay positive, and press on with her battle against cancer till the very end.\n\nAs the saying goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed, and my mum is truly someone I know I can always fall back on, even when the going gets tough. I was particularly inspired by this incident, as it also showed me that incredible things can happen, when women support each other.\n\nAs we celebrate SG Women this year, I hope we can all shift mindsets to foster a more inclusive society for both men and women. üôåüèª\n\nWe‚Äôve come far but there‚Äôs more to be done!

She then went on to receive education in a mission school, and later joined St Andrew's Mission Hospital as a nurse. \n\nDuring World War II, she was captured by the Japanese and made a ‚Äòcomfort woman‚Äô. Thankfully for her, she managed to escape once again, and returned to nursing at St Andrew's. \n\nNot long after, Janet became Singapore's first Asian hospital matron, and the first woman in Singapore to publish a book in English. \n\nI am awed by Janet‚Äôs grit and tenacity in overcoming the odds and rising above adversity to change the course of her life. To me, she is a true inspiration to many women (and men alike) of our future generations - nothing is impossible if one sets out to achieve it. \n\nThis year, join me in celebrating SG Women and show appreciation for all the wonderful women in your life! üíô \n\nLet‚Äôs take part in the Conversations on Singapore Women‚Äôs Development at go.gov.sg/sgwomen, and build a better, more inclusive society. \n \n#CelebratingSGWomen @msfcares","location":"Singapore","locationId":105565836144069,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername1":"msfcares","id":"2500886518949044849_7697146","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:27.225Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CKy8Hi2pWTY/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/edmund_chenofficial","username":"edmund_chenofficial","likeCount":8,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo shared by Edmund ‰πãË¥¢ Official Fan page on February 02, 2021 tagging @xiang_yun_, and @msfcares.","pubDate":"2021-02-02T16:06:45.000Z","description":"[[ Photo taken from: @xiang_yun_ IG]] \n\nÂÜØÊ≤ÅÈ¢úÊòØÊàëÈùíÊò•Êó∂‰ª£ÁöÑÂ•ΩÊúãÂèãÔºåÂ•πÂÉèËÆ∏Â§ö‰∏∫Á§æÂå∫‰∫∫ÈªòÈªò‰ªòÂá∫ÁöÑ‰∫∫‰∏ÄÊ†∑ÔºåÈÉΩËØ¥Ëá™Â∑±Ê≤°ÂÅö‰∫Ü‰ªÄ‰πà„ÄÇÂú®ËøáÂéªÁöÑÊó•Â≠êÔºåÂ•πÂõ∫ÂÆöÁöÑÂú®‰πêÈæÑÁ§æÂå∫ÂèäËÄÅ‰∫∫ÁßüËµÅÁªÑÂ±ãÂå∫‰∏éÂπ¥ÈïøËÄÖÁõ∏Â§ÑÔºåÈÄÅÈ•≠„ÄÅÈô™‰º¥‰∏éÊèê‰æõÂ®±‰πêËäÇÁõÆÔºåÂêåÊó∂‰πüÂú®ÂÅöÁùÄ‰∏Ä‰ª∂‰∫ã„ÄÇÂ∞±ÊòØ‰∏∫Ëøô‰∫õ‚ÄúËÄÅ‚ÄùÊúãÂèãÂàÜÊãÖ‰∏éÂ§ÑÁêÜË∫´ÂêéÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂàáÊâìÁÇπÔºå‰∏∫‰ªñ‰ª¨Â∏¶Êù•Âø´‰πê„ÄÅÂ∏åÊúõ‰∏éÂÆâÂøÉ„ÄÇÊàë‰∏∫Ê≤ÅÈ¢úÊÑüÂà∞È™ÑÂÇ≤Ôºå‰πüÈùûÂ∏∏Êï¨‰Ω©Â•πÔºåÊõ¥Â∏åÊúõÂ•πÂíåËÆ∏Â§öÂêå‰º¥ÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂàá‰ªòÂá∫ËÉΩÂ§üÂæóÂà∞Êõ¥Â§ö‰∫∫ÁöÑËÆ§ÂèØÂíåÊîØÊåÅ„ÄÇ ÂØπÂ•≥ÊÄßÂèëÂ±ïËØæÈ¢òÊúâÂÖ¥Ë∂£ÁöÑÔºåÂèØ‰ª•Âà∞go.gov.sg/SGWomen ÂèÇÂä†‚ÄúÊñ∞Âä†Âù°Â•≥ÊÄßÂèëÂ±ïÂØπËØù‚Äù„ÄÇ \n\n#CelebratingSGWomen @msfcares\n\n#XIANGYUN \n#Âêë‰∫ë\n#EDMUNDCHENOFFICIALFC","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Âêë‰∫ëXiang Yun's Official Account","taggedUsername1":"xiang_yun_","taggedFullName2":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername2":"msfcares","id":"2500325144395080920_32225642952","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:27.225Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CKyDDbWHflJ/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/daughtersoftomorrow","username":"daughtersoftomorrow","likeCount":134,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2021-02-02T07:48:07.000Z","description":"Did you know?

In Singapore, as much as we have done a great job in clamping down on these, it still happens and sometimes, unknowingly. \n\nWe believe physical and drug abuse are never one off but collated small, subtle and unknowing choices that resulted as such. \n\nLike allowing your partner to get away with disrespecting you with words, followed by physically pushing you, slapping you and eventually hurting you.üëä\n\nLike allowing your peers to insist you on taking something \"fun\" like weed because everyone is doing it, followed by happy pills and eventually trying something worse. üíä\n\nSometimes, a call for help seems weak but to us, it is one of the most courageous thing to do.

I am heartened to hear from the personal experiences of Singaporeans, particularly our youth from different background and causes (i.e. CYGO Youth Advisory Group, Mendaki Club, NEBO, etc), their thoughts on women-related issues, and what more we can do as a society. Views and feedback gathered from these engagements will be presented as a White Paper in Parliament in 2021.\n\nXue Ling, Rahayu and I would like to hear more from you ‚Äì women and men alike ‚Äì on this matter. Your feedback can help to shape programmes, policies, and legislation in Singapore to better support and uplift women. We are at the cusp of positive change, and I encourage you to partner with us in our efforts to create a better society for all.¬†\n\nMinister's keynote speech is available on @mhasingapore 's

And it is just as important for us to know where we can refer our friends and family to when they call out for help.\n+\nI hope that even if you have never been a victim, you can familiarise yourself with some of these resources, so that if anyone approaches you for help, especially during this time, you know where they can go to seek professional help.\n+\nIf you are a victim, then you are incredibly strong. But please know that you don't have to be strong alone. You can share your burdens. There are people who will believe you and hear you out. There is a chance for things to get better for you. Good luck.\n+\n*Please note that I shortened long URLs using tinyurl.com. If they do not work, you can try googling key words and the site you are looking for should be the first to pop up.

It is practiced and adhered to by parents and children alike when dropping off at, or fetching from the centre.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThere are aplenty visuals and signs to help us with this and Bray demonstrates in the cover pic. He was so excited to return to school, in a mask no less! Within the centre, many similar signs were also put up to remind the children to do their part. This I'm assured of as the Centre Principal and his teachers had already briefed us ahead the previous Friday via a private zoom session with us parents before school even started. Also, My First Skool even developed a back-to-school kit with lots of tips and activities for transiting from home back to schools! We highly recommend that you read it with your child too! (Go to https://bit.ly/mfs-back-to-school-kit #linkinbio!)‚Å£\n‚Å£\nI especially want to thank how My First Skool supported us in preparing Bray for back-to-school. I mean, sure, we can do endless activities revolving around covid-19 (also part of his home based learning), but nothing beats a special tea time his teachers organised in the week before school reopened.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThey put on their uniform, login zoom at the designated timing, smashed up some eggs together, made themselves sandwiches and milk, and chanted their same before-meal cheer which they always do together in school!‚Å£\n‚Å£\nFor the children, it was an awesome catch up with each other over their self-made tea snacks. For me as I saw it, it was a seamless simulation of how school has always been - their patient teachers guiding them through their hands-on activities together, and the camaraderie in class that has always been there.

Considering most of us don‚Äôt live in a mansion where you get your own personal space; a darker and less talked about side of couple quarantine is how the time spent together also gives rise to the potential risk of conflict. With varying styles in handling different situations, daily small annoyance can quickly escalate to a full blown war. We all need to understand that we are all strangers in these unprecedented times. With the added pressure of work uncertainties and the inability to head out to do what we want, we are all feeling it regardless if we put it out there anot. It‚Äôs also in these times that we all need to learn to be a little bit more patient to the people around. Let the situation draw us closer rather than pull us apart. Let us all learn to be abit more giving and understanding towards each other - for as a couple, it‚Äôs never you against them, it‚Äôs always going to be you against the world. Learn to let the little things go for it‚Äôs the bigger picture of being together that‚Äôs truly worth fighting for. Stay hopeful, stay strong and when we all pull through this together, this period would be one of the stories we tell our kids for the ages.\n#sgunited #stayhomesg \n#sgweddingphotography #sgweddingphotographer #sgcouple #sgcouples #dearcovid19sg \nhttps://www.thecollectivememories.com","location":"Singapore","locationId":105565836144069,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"National Youth Council S'pore","taggedUsername1":"nycsg","taggedFullName2":"SingaporeBrides Wedding Inspo","taggedUsername2":"singaporebridesweddings","taggedFullName3":"Castlery Singapore","taggedUsername3":"castlerysg","taggedFullName4":"Leo Tay /Underground Designer","taggedUsername4":"the_3_keys","taggedFullName5":"MCCY Singapore","taggedUsername5":"mccysg","taggedFullName6":"Sony Singapore","taggedUsername6":"sonysingapore","taggedFullName7":"S U P E R  F A R M E R S","taggedUsername7":"superfarmers","taggedFullName8":"Couple by 9GAG","taggedUsername8":"couple","taggedFullName9":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername9":"msfcares","taggedFullName10":"Couple Goals ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏","taggedUsername10":"couples.off","taggedFullName11":"Dirty Boots and Messy Hair","taggedUsername11":"dirtybootsandmessyhair","taggedFullName12":"Online Plants + Pots Boutique","taggedUsername12":"tumbleweedplantssg","taggedFullName13":"PottaPlantta","taggedUsername13":"pottaplantta","taggedFullName14":"Couples Goals","taggedUsername14":"couplegoalslust","id":"2317523872504354510_12019695906","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:45.864Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAjzLfUgkAn/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/en.abled","username":"en.abled","likeCount":84,"commentCount":1,"caption":"Photo shared by (en)able on May 23, 2020 tagging @teamsingapore, @sdsc, @spdsingapore, @msfcares, @dpa.sg, @bekindsg, @carecornersg, and @downsyndromesingapore.","pubDate":"2020-05-24T05:46:06.000Z","description":"~ be part of the movement ~\nPhoto taken from @specialolympics","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Team Singapore","taggedUsername1":"teamsingapore","taggedFullName2":"SG Disability Sports Council","taggedUsername2":"sdsc","taggedFullName3":"SPD","taggedUsername3":"spdsingapore","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"Disabled People's Association","taggedUsername5":"dpa.sg","taggedFullName6":"Be Kind SG","taggedUsername6":"bekindsg","taggedFullName7":"Care Corner Singapore","taggedUsername7":"carecornersg","taggedFullName8":"Down Syndrome Association","taggedUsername8":"downsyndromesingapore","id":"2315919723314954279_1490158027","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:47:45.864Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAdLeilH3KM/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/belandbray","username":"belandbray","likeCount":230,"commentCount":118,"caption":"","pubDate":"2020-05-21T16:03:44.000Z","description":"{Counselling services offering support for families and individuals during COVID-19}‚Å£\n‚Å£\nTL;DR‚Å£\nFREE counselling help/support:‚Å£\n- for marital/divorce/parenting issues‚Å£\nüëâ www.cphonlinecounselling.sg‚Å£\n- for mental wellness/marital/parenting support‚Å£\nüëâ National CARE Hotline at 1800-202-6868‚Å£\n‚Å£\n======================================‚Å£\n‚Å£\nDuring this period where families are staying home and spending more time with one another, relationships can be strained and there is a possibility that frictions may occur if there are underlying tensions or new anxieties and concerns to arise.‚Å£\n‚Å£\n@msfcares Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has worked with the #CommunityPsychologyHub to provide online counselling at¬†www.cphonlinecounselling.sg.¬†This FREE service supports people with marital, divorce or parenting issues.

It is rather the OPPOSITE. The military‚Äôs true effectiveness is in the battles it DOES NOT have to fight (i.e. the lives it DOES NOT have to sacrifice to war) and the bullets/missiles it DOES NOT have to fire. If our military doesn‚Äôt have targets to shoot at, that is mission success. Because it means no enemies dare cross us, and we may enjoy a modicum of peace. It‚Äôs called Deterrence.\n\nIt‚Äôs a peace and stability that we as a people, even the folks at TOC, get to take for granted.

But with no support from their father, it was very difficult!\n.\nHaving two young kids with special needs, I had to quit my job as a food stall helper to stay home and take care of the one who was unable to get into student care. Managing a big family like mine made it hard to find time to do anything else, much less go out to work.\n.\nMy work options are limited especially due to the lack of caregiving support I receive for my triplets, so I have been sourcing for home-based work that is tailored to my sewing skills. SPIN linked me up with a social enterprise called E&S Blessing‚Äã that guided me in starting a small home-based business to supplement my family's income. I was the first on board their Celebrating Dreams mentoring initiative that aims to support single mothers, like myself, by providing us a platform to tap on our skills.\n.\nAs going out to find a job is a big difficulty for me, opportunities like this have been so helpful because they enable me to earn some money while being assured that my children are well taken care off. I'm hoping to improve my sewing skills and will definitely go for classes if they're available!\n.\nWith SPIN‚Äôs assistance and support, I have been empowered to make small changes to improve my situation. It is not easy, but I will try my best because I like being a mom. On one part, it‚Äôs okay and fun. On the other, it is also very stressful.

At that time, I had nobody to talk to about this, neither did I have any newborn items to prepare for my baby's arrival.\n.\nI was referred to SPIN when I was 4 months pregnant and they journeyed with me until my delivery. I was blessed with baby clothes, maternity clothes, and other items that I didn't even know I would need.\n.\nThey continued to support me even after I gave birth. When a SPIN volunteer found out I had no cupboard to store my baby's clothes, she pooled her resources to get me brand-new plastic drawers to keep the clothes neatly. It was also through SPIN that I learned how to raise my newborn daughter with the help of a child nurse volunteer and lactation consultant. Without them, I would still be unable to feed my daughter because of her lip and tongue ties.\n.\nIn my time with SPIN, I've attended several empowerment sessions that allowed me to open up and learn from fellow mothers who have gone through similar situations as me. These sessions have taught me practical skills such as solids-making tips, and have also inspired me to make steps towards pursuing my dreams through activities such as vision-boarding. I'm grateful to the volunteers who help watch our children so that we, parents, can make the most of these inspiring workshops.\n.\nMy daughter is now my priority. Even if I have to forgo my income for days, I will keep her at home when she is sick so she can rest properly. I want to create a hygienic, safe and conducive home environment for her, make sure she has clean clothes to wear, clean bedsheets to sleep on, and clean toys to play with.

Many educators I met told me how their families, friends and colleagues are sources of inspiration and motivation for them to become the best teachers they can be. \nAll of us play a part in giving every child a good start.

It was great getting to interact with other mums because we could relate to each other, share our experiences and encourage one another.\n.\nI have to admit that it's still not easy to be a single mom, but at least I don't feel alone and I know that SPIN will be there to support me into becoming a good mom.\"\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#successstory #dayspring #testimony #empoweringwomen #sgcares #family #humansofsingapore #singlemother #singleparenting #singlemom #socialservice #msfcares #humansofsingapore #changemaker #makeadifference","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"AWARE Singapore","taggedUsername1":"awaresingapore","taggedFullName2":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername2":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName3":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername3":"msfcares","taggedFullName4":"Daughters Of Tomorrow (DOT)","taggedUsername4":"daughtersoftomorrow","taggedFullName5":"SG Cares","taggedUsername5":"singaporecares","taggedFullName6":"Beanstalk Singapore (ECDA)","taggedUsername6":"beanstalksingapore","id":"2152794337119887630_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:02.059Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3bHLEHjWSH/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":29,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on October 09, 2019 tagging @who, @comchestsg, @ncss.sg, @msfcares, @letstalkaboutmentalhealth, @singaporecares, @smhff, @iamellie.sg, and @beyondthelabelsg.","pubDate":"2019-10-10T04:05:06.000Z","description":"Today is World Mental Health Day! üí™ Make a difference to a friend or loved one struggling with a mental health condition today with these tips:\n.\n- Listen and let them know you are there to help\n- Be understanding and treat them with respect\n- Refrain from using labels\n- Help them access mental health services\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#WorldMentalHealthDay #beyondthelabel #letstalkaboutmentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthtips #mythbuster #mentalhealthday #togetheragainststigma #socialservice #makeadifference #changemaker #sgcares","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"World Health Organization","taggedUsername1":"who","taggedFullName2":"Community Chest Singapore","taggedUsername2":"comchestsg","taggedFullName3":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername3":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"Lets Talk About Mental Health","taggedUsername5":"letstalkaboutmentalhealth","taggedFullName6":"SG Cares","taggedUsername6":"singaporecares","taggedFullName7":"SG Mental Health Film Fest","taggedUsername7":"smhff","taggedFullName8":"Ellie, Mental Health Elephant","taggedUsername8":"iamellie.sg","taggedFullName9":"Beyond the Label","taggedUsername9":"beyondthelabelsg","id":"2151344793661039751_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:02.059Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ZQrjml6FP/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/little_mighty_media","username":"little_mighty_media","likeCount":39,"commentCount":2,"caption":"","pubDate":"2019-10-09T10:49:42.000Z","description":"Cheers to the end of 3 days covering NCSS 40U40 which included engagements with established leaders, trips to the istana, parliament, dignity kitchen.\n.\nGreat for us to gain refreshing insights about these social issues, various concepts and for me (Brenda) to stay relevant to the social sector and contribute in little, mighty ways even though my name card no longer says \"social worker\" for the time being!

Penny* knew that feeling all too well. Here's her story.\n.\n‚ÄúI always doubted whether I was important to my family because I was either beaten, abused or chase out of my house. No one ever fought for me, only with me.\n.\nHaving two dads, I never knew who my biological father was. But it didn‚Äôt matter because I was abused by him anyway ‚Äì beaten, scolded and forced into doing chores. Even my mum couldn‚Äôt help me because my dad would beat her too.\n.\nThere were even times when my mum was the one who chased me out when we argued or when she was drunk. Running away from home became the new normal. My mum had to file a missing person report multiple times.\n.\nEven when my family problems subsided, I would still runaway because my friends showed me more love than my family ever did. I felt more comfortable being out than at home. But my friends landed me on the wrong path of smoking, drinking and other bad things.\n.\nEven though I tried to change for the better, my past still affected me and my family problems still persisted ‚Äì so I just went back to how I used to be. Soon, I was sent to Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre because I stopped attending school and constantly ran away from home.\n.\nBeing at Dayspring has helped me learn how to cope with my family problems. The staff also guided me through my trust issues and helped to build my self-esteem. I hope that my family will be able to live happily with each other and not fight as much anymore ‚Äì neither do I want to be chased away by my mum again.‚Äù\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#successstory #dayspring #testimony #empoweringwomen #girlssupportgirls #girlssupportinggirls #empowerment #abusesurvivor #sgcares #abusedwomen #family #humansofsingapore #msfcares","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Community Chest Singapore","taggedUsername1":"comchestsg","taggedFullName2":"GIVE.asia","taggedUsername2":"giveasia","taggedFullName3":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername3":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","id":"2137571818383507170_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:02.059Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2n1WKwHqLT/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/thegooddesigners","username":"thegooddesigners","likeCount":12,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo by The Good Designers | Courses in 6RQ Office Suites with @chuanjin1, @dbsbank, @skillsfuturesg, @msfcares, @learn.sg, and @thegooddesigners.

Our families bring us joy and meaning, comfort and companionship. \nHelping more young people see that raising a family is Achievable, Enjoyable and Celebrated ‚Äì this is what we, as a society, can collectively do to make Singapore a Great Place for Families. \nYesterday, @desmond.lee, @dramykhor, and I visited one of My First Skool‚Äôs newest preschools @Punggol. Always a joy to be among kids. \nWe shared more details on some of the areas that PM @leehsienloong had spoken about at #NDR2019. Healthcare, preschool, and housing are concerns that shape the decisions of many young Singaporeans, who are considering marriage, and starting their family. We will further support Singaporeans in three key areas: \n1)Making quality preschool more affordable and accessible for families\n\n2)Extending support to first-time home buyers. @lawrencewongst will share more next month.\n\n3)Providing more healthcare support for couples and children \nMore details on the enhancements can be found at https://www.heybaby.sg. \nMany Singaporeans want to have meaningful family lives, while establishing fulfilling careers. Workplace cultures and norms need to become more supportive of family life. But this is a cultural issue that Government policies alone cannot address. To improve work-life harmony in Singapore, we need to tackle the issues together. Next month, the Citizens‚Äô Panel on Work-Life Harmony will look into ways to create more family-friendly workplaces. \nI hope parents take the enhancements in Government support in the right spirit. In some countries, the parents pocket the savings and re-direct their efforts to spending quality time with their children. Lighten your burden, and make raising children more enjoyable. \nLet us all help one another to keep parenting enjoyable. It‚Äôs not a race against one another, but a journey of joy and love we can all take together. \n#Singapore #ndrsg #family #instagram","location":"Singapore","locationId":105565836144069,"type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Instagram","taggedUsername1":"instagram","taggedFullName2":"Lee Hsien Loong","taggedUsername2":"leehsienloong","taggedFullName3":"MND Singapore","taggedUsername3":"mndsingapore","taggedFullName4":"Desmond Lee","taggedUsername4":"desmond.lee","taggedFullName5":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername5":"msfcares","taggedFullName6":"Dr Amy Khor","taggedUsername6":"dramykhor","id":"2121067324183143126_6107779569","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:03.665Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1qc-ZcHYSt/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":17,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on August 27, 2019 tagging @cnb.drugfreesg, @yellowribbonsg, @comchestsg, @ncss.sg, and @msfcares.","pubDate":"2019-08-27T10:01:25.000Z","description":"#DidYouKnow: More companies are now willing to hire ex-offenders!

Here's his story.\n.\n‚ÄúI spent half my age in and out of prison for drug-related offences. It was after NS that I had my first taste of drugs out of curiosity, but things started to collapse when I got introduced to heroin. I kept thinking to myself: I can quit any time. Little did I know that I would only keep tumbling.\n.\nDuring my incarceration, I constantly gave false hope to my family ‚Äì each time claiming that it would be ‚Äúthe last‚Äù. I even wrote them letters. But despite all of this, I would always fall back down again. It was only after my last release that I made a resolution to myself and my family that this was truly the last time.\n.\nEven though I was the black sheep of my family, my mother and brother would always come to visit me. But there was a time when my mum didn‚Äôt visit for 3 months. Puzzled, I later found that she was ill and bedridden. This made me very anxious about my release so I could visit her. Thankfully, I managed to see her upon my release and spend the last 3 years of her life by her side.\n.\nBeing a reserved individual, I always kept to myself and didn‚Äôt really like to mix around a lot. After coming to Highpoint, I started to open up my mind to what‚Äôs good for me ‚Äì which is socialising with people. Now, I look forward to exposing myself to new people and experiences. I want to see more to my life than just ‚Äòme‚Äô and ‚Äòdrugs‚Äô. After all, a colourful life doesn‚Äôt need to come from drugs. There are so many other ways to feel that ‚Äòhigh‚Äô, you can dance, play soccer, but drugs is not the thing.\n.\nI‚Äôve been sober for the past 4 years. Until now, I haven‚Äôt had the slightest chance to see what drugs look like ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt intend to either. It is unfortunate that my mum can‚Äôt see where I am now, but I am sure she will be proud of me from where she is.‚Äù\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#testimony #successstory #lifestory #exoffender #drugaddicts #empowerment #empoweringmen #sgcares #msfcares #humansofsingapore #turnoveranewleaf #DrugFreeSG @cnb.drugfreesg","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"CNB Drug Free SG","taggedUsername1":"cnb.drugfreesg","taggedFullName2":"Yellow Ribbon Singapore","taggedUsername2":"yellowribbonsg","taggedFullName3":"GIVE.asia","taggedUsername3":"giveasia","taggedFullName4":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername4":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName5":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername5":"msfcares","id":"2117278026554277992_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:05.426Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1dlAM3gVpX/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":17,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on August 22, 2019 tagging @comchestsg, @ncss.sg, and @msfcares.

Here's her story.\n.\n‚ÄúNever once did I expect to be abused by my own family. I was sexually abused by my grandfather and three cousins, while my aunties often verbally abused me by calling me names. The name-calling continued in school where I was bullied for my size and skin-colour.\n.\nI needed a way to numb the pain so I began cutting myself ‚Äì first out of curiosity, and then as an addiction. Cutting became my drug, to the point where I would cut myself every day after school. It was a form of self-punishment for anything that happened in life, even if it was something small.\n.\nHonestly, I didn‚Äôt see a reason to continue living and attempted my first suicide in 2014. This landed me in a children‚Äôs home where I attempted suicide again. This time, I took enough drugs to feel the pain, but not enough to die.\n.\nI was sent to a safer place ‚Äì HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre. DRTC helped me to cope with my past and my depression. I mean, no one can cure my illness, but there are people who can help me to help myself. And that was what DRTC did for me.\n.\nThey helped me find my voice, when I thought I had lost it forever; they started me on the journey towards freedom.‚Äù\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#successstory #dayspring #testimony #empoweringwomen #girlssupportgirls #girlssupportinggirls #empowerment #abusesurvivor #sgcares #abusedwomen #family #humansofsingapore #msfcares","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Humans of Singapore","taggedUsername1":"humansofsingapore","taggedFullName2":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername2":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName3":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername3":"msfcares","taggedFullName4":"SG Cares","taggedUsername4":"singaporecares","id":"2102057699575089803_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:05.426Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0iWv7NAItu/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":24,"commentCount":1,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on July 30, 2019 tagging @yellowribbonsg, @kindnesssg, @ncss.sg, @msfcares, and @singaporecares.","pubDate":"2019-07-30T10:01:42.000Z","description":"#DidYouKnow: Friendships are scientifically proven to promote better emotional health and happiness!\n.\nFor our beneficiaries, these friendships are an important source of socio-emotional support and can come in the form of staff, volunteers and even returning alumni members.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#internationalfriendshipday #friendship #socialservice #socialsupport #sgcares #makeadifference #changemaker","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Yellow Ribbon Singapore","taggedUsername1":"yellowribbonsg","taggedFullName2":"Singapore Kindness Movement","taggedUsername2":"kindnesssg","taggedFullName3":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername3":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"SG Cares","taggedUsername5":"singaporecares","id":"2099340426715630446_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:05.426Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0H9dwTg5m5/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":29,"commentCount":0,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on July 19, 2019 tagging @ncss.sg, @msfcares, @singaporecares, and @socialservicesgconnect.","pubDate":"2019-07-20T04:00:31.000Z","description":"#IVolunteerBecause I want to empower single parents to prepare home-cooked meals for their families.\n.\n\"Home should be a refuge for the family.

Because of these experiences, I grew up filled with anger and I constantly felt like I could never trust anyone in my life. Whenever I was upset, I would lash out and hit the people who tried to show me care.\n.\nBut things changed when I came to HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre (DRTC). I started to feel safe and accepted by staff who persistently showed me care and support. They helped me recognise how my past had such a big impact on how I reacted to people in different situations.\n.\nNow, I am learning to regulate my emotions and discover more about myself. As I do so, it has helped me to build deeper relationships and live peacefully with others around me.

Here's what a volunteer with our single parents at HCSA Dayspring SPIN thinks!‚ò∫Ô∏è\n.\n\"In my five years of managing and building a parenting community online, I have witnessed this not a just a few but many times. Yes, the community of friends and even strangers who have common goals can help and at times better than relatives.\n.\nMy online parenting community online, BabyChakra‚Äã, sees this happen every single day. Mothers and Fathers login to the App and discuss their parenting issues. Some have even become very good friends.\n.\nIt may not be as easy when meeting face to face. You may wonder ‚ÄúWhat do I talk about?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow and why will a stranger help?‚Äù These are common hesitations. But just stop and think. The people in the community, SPIN, have many things in common. They understand your concerns and challenges as a single parent. They are more likely to show empathy and care for you. They may just have some advice that can help you.\n.\nEven if you are not looking for advice, being a part of a meaningful group of friends who help each other is a great feeling in itself. The sense of belonging fills you up with an unbeatable courage and confidence.\n.\nTake it slow if you like. Your comfort is most important. You may start off with a casual meeting and just introduce yourself. Share with the group what you like to do. Take small steps to participate and interact with other single parents at SPIN. All it takes is a few small steps to being a confident person and parent. SPIN is here for you.\"\n.\nBe a part of the online parenting community here: wwww.BabyChakra.com\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#babychakra #empowerment #empoweringwomen #singlemother #parenting #pregnancy #singleparenting #singleparents #parentingcommunity #sgparents #empoweringparents","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername1":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName2":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername2":"msfcares","taggedFullName3":"BabyChakra | Parenting Partner","taggedUsername3":"mybabychakra","taggedFullName4":"SG Cares","taggedUsername4":"singaporecares","id":"2070349226465829577_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:08.455Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByxYPugFAEy/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/little_mighty_media","username":"little_mighty_media","likeCount":28,"commentCount":1,"caption":"","pubDate":"2019-06-16T13:00:36.000Z","description":"Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the Papas in the world!

With my past and my bankruptcy status, it was almost impossible to find a job.I desperately needed one as I had no family support.\n.\nSince I joined SPIN, my children and I have experienced so much smiles and laughter. I could never afford to fulfill my children‚Äôs dreams, but SPIN changed that for me! They provided us with food rations, furniture and toys, and even organised many fun outings. More importantly, SPIN supported me in gaining financial independence by arranging a job interview with a partner corporate organisation. They helped me establish a stable routine of work and care-giving to best support my family.\n.\nThrough events and SPIN empowerment sessions, I started to widen my social support circle by meeting with volunteers and other SPIN members like myself. I am very appreciative of the help and joy that SPIN gave me in becoming a responsible mother who has clear goals and stable employment. Because of that, I have now decided to become an ally volunteer to help other members in need.\"\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#testimonialthursday #successstory #dayspring #testimony #empoweringwomen #empowermen #sgcares #family #humansofsingapore #singlemother #singleparenting #socialservice","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername1":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName2":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername2":"msfcares","taggedFullName3":"SG Cares","taggedUsername3":"singaporecares","taggedFullName4":"Social Service SG-Connect","taggedUsername4":"socialservicesgconnect","id":"2024688363637852733_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:09.681Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwT9YCoHSd1/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/factually.sg","username":"factually.sg","likeCount":9,"commentCount":1,"caption":"Photo by FActually Singapore in Lavender MRT Station with @msfcares.","pubDate":"2019-04-16T09:45:03.000Z","description":"The individuals talking to the elderly are staff from the Social Service Office (SSO) @ Jalan Besar.\n\nThe two elderly men are known to the SSO, as we are supporting one of them with ComCare Long Term Assistance, and assisting the other with his application for financial assistance.\n\nSSO officers were following up by checking on their well-being and assessing how else we can support them.\n\nBuilding an inclusive and a caring society is a collective effort.\n\nIf you come across individuals or families who require support, please reach out to us at our ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 or approach the nearest SSO (www.msf.gov.sg/ssolocator) or Family Service Centre (www.msf.gov.sg/fsclocator).

Here's the story of how she found a place to call home.\n.\n\"Being the only child in my family with no close relatives, I had never experienced what family warmth and love felt like. I was even labelled as an aggressive child in my previous placements when all I ever really wanted was to have a family.\n.\nI was referred to HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre (DRTC) in 2017 after undergoing several placements. During my stay in DRTC, I tried very hard to fit in and to be accepted. I couldn‚Äôt regulate my emotions and often had difficulties in managing my feelings. It took me a while, but I was soon able to build rapport with the other girls and staff. I realised I didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äòtry to fit in‚Äô, I just needed to see myself as who I was.\n.\nIn the safe environment of DRTC, I learned how to rationalise my feelings, discovered my strengths and found a sense of belonging. I learned that people cared a lot for me and started to reciprocate this love to others. I was introduced to a befriending family during my stay and treatment. They gave me a sense of security and permanence. There, I finally has a place to call home.\n.\nGraduating from DRTC was truly a dream come true for me as I finally had a family to go home to. I am now in my final year of school and I feel very much motivated as I finally see hope for my future.\"\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#testimonialthursday #successstory #dayspring #testimony #empoweringwomen #girlssupportgirls #empowerment #abusesurvivor #sgcares #abusedwomen #abusedgirl #family #humansofsingapore","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Humans of Singapore","taggedUsername1":"humansofsingapore","taggedFullName2":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername2":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName3":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername3":"msfcares","taggedFullName4":"SG Cares","taggedUsername4":"singaporecares","id":"2019614961168516940_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:09.681Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvtXTHTl_ga/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":38,"commentCount":1,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on April 01, 2019 tagging @humansofsingapore, @ncss.sg, @msfcares, and @singaporecares.

Here's her story.\n.\n\"My family moved to Singapore when I was 9 years old. My father changed jobs multiple times and starting beating my mother out of stress. They fought a lot and my mother returned to China, leaving me with my father and uncle to finish my studies.\n.\nThe uncle sexually abused me, gave me drinks and cigarettes, and kept offering me money to get what he wanted. Even when I was in pain, my uncle didn‚Äôt care. Whenever he got angry, my father scolded me for not doing anything for him ‚Äì the fact was, I did, but couldn‚Äôt tell the truth. I started self-harming, and attempted suicide.\n.\nI was brought to the police station after a teacher at school called my child protection officer after noticing that I was going through a crisis. My father and uncle kept calling but I was too afraid to pick up the phone. Eventually, I was warded in the hospital and sent to Dayspring for treatment.\n.\nI struggled for a long time trying to overcome my past. I kept blaming myself. I cut myself many times, once even on the neck in front of the other Dayspring girls. But after that cut, I realised that it simply was not worth it to keep hurting myself because it did not solve any problems. So, I stopped self-harming.\n.\nNow, I tell myself and others: ‚ÄòThe past is past. Now is the present. Make sure you live in the present fully and positively.‚Äô I hope that those who have gone through abuse like me can be stronger and not give up ‚Äì even though it is difficult most of the time.\"\n.\n.\n.\n#testimonythursday #dayspring #testimony #empoweringwomen #girlssupportgirls #empowerment #abusesurvivor #successstory #sgcares #abusedwomen #humansofsingapore #mentalhealthawareness #family","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Humans of Singapore","taggedUsername1":"humansofsingapore","taggedFullName2":"AWARE Singapore","taggedUsername2":"awaresingapore","taggedFullName3":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername3":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","taggedFullName5":"SG Cares","taggedUsername5":"singaporecares","taggedFullName6":"Social Service SG-Connect","taggedUsername6":"socialservicesgconnect","id":"2009462781390061292_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:09.681Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvVnJx5hkLx/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/hcsacommunityservices","username":"hcsacommunityservices","likeCount":54,"commentCount":2,"caption":"Photo shared by HCSA Community Services on March 22, 2019 tagging @unwomen, @unitedwomensingapore, @ncss.sg, and @msfcares.","pubDate":"2019-03-23T04:37:57.000Z","description":"Being a Dayspring mentor is more than just a job, it's about building deep and caring relationships with girls who have experienced trauma and abuse - helping them realise that they too are deserving of love üíï\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dayspring #vulnerable #empoweringwomen #empoweredwomen #empowerment #dogood #giveback #internationalwomensday #iwd2019 #womenshistorymonth #girlssupportgirls #girlssupportinggirls #abusedwomen #mentoring","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"UN Women","taggedUsername1":"unwomen","taggedFullName2":"United Women Singapore","taggedUsername2":"unitedwomensingapore","taggedFullName3":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername3":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName4":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername4":"msfcares","id":"2005681404931097329_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:11.753Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvT3pjoBXki/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/mommyntrinity","username":"mommyntrinity","likeCount":167,"commentCount":22,"caption":"Photo by üíûTrinity and Mommyüá∏üá¨SGüíû in Singapore with @thenewageparents, @thosecozyhomes, @theasianparent, @singaporemotherhood, @singaporeschild, @parentsworldsg, @kids.wall, @msfcares, and @supreme_parents.","pubDate":"2019-03-22T12:23:37.000Z","description":"I deliberated a long time as to whether to post this photo (no prizes for guessing when this was takenüòù) coz the three of us were looking in different directions.

But on her 16th birthday, everything changed. Here's her story.\n.\n\"I was only fifteen when I first attempted suicide, and I was diagnosed with clinical depression. This was after many years of immense pressure from school, hurtful words by my peers, and frequent quarrels at home. But when I told my psychiatrist about the violence at home, I was surprised by her shocked reaction. All along, I thought my father‚Äôs violence was normal and happened in other families.\n.\nShortly after starting therapy, I began having flashbacks of being sexually abused by my father and more memories returned. The violence continued with my father hurling various objects at us and calling me useless for not being a boy. The next year, I started experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. I attempted another suicide; the final push to act on it came after my father touched me again.\n.\nOn my 16th birthday, I arrived at Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre and my life has never been the same. Dayspring turned out to be a strong pillar of support, helping me through difficult times in school and with my family. Even when I experienced suicidal thoughts, the staff never gave up on me and remained understanding and patient. Being at Dayspring helped me to organise my thoughts.\n.\nSurprisingly, when I saw my father for the first time after entering Dayspring, I was not angry at all. I felt at peace. I realised I had forgiven him. I told him that I believed he was a good person deep down. I understood: it is through forgiveness that we free ourselves and others from the invisible shackles that once held all of us down. This was when I knew how much Dayspring had changed me.\"\n.\n.\n.\n#dayspring #testimonytuesday #testimony #empoweringwomen #girlssupportgirls #empowerment #abusesurvivor #successstory #givingtuesday #sgcares #abusedwomen #mentalhealthawareness #family","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Humans of Singapore","taggedUsername1":"humansofsingapore","taggedFullName2":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername2":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName3":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername3":"msfcares","taggedFullName4":"Lets Talk About Mental Health","taggedUsername4":"letstalkaboutmentalhealth","taggedFullName5":"SG Cares","taggedUsername5":"singaporecares","id":"1989177968626567561_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:11.753Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BuNRbCwhrI0/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/theartfacultysg","username":"theartfacultysg","likeCount":62,"commentCount":0,"caption":"","pubDate":"2019-02-23T02:22:45.000Z","description":"#SPOTTED!\nDid you manage to spot one of our #differentlyAbled artists‚Äô artwork used as backdrop for Minister Heng‚Äôs budget dialogue on Channel 8‚Äôs È¢ÑÁÆóÊ°à Â§ßÂÆ∂Ë∞à?

Read her story below to find out ‚ù§Ô∏è\n.\n\"When I was taken away from my family to live at Dayspring, I thought I would resent this place a lot and I told myself not to trust the professionals anymore. I was someone who wasn't aware of my emotions and physical well-being. I wasn't afraid of risks and even though I knew I would have to bear the consequences of doing anything against the law, the devil in me just wanted to be a rebel. The only thing that mattered to me was being cool and having a lot of friends.\n.\nBut as time went by, I became grateful to have the chance to stay in this wonderful place as I realised it would bring great benefits not just for myself but for my family as well. I was blessed with a befriender family that journeyed by my side and taught me the importance of honest communication in the family. Everything started to change as my family and I learned how to better communicate with each other\n.\nDayspring changed me into a whole new person with new values. I used to lie a lot but now I value honesty so much. I started to be more mindful and appreciative with what I was given. I started to cherish values like change, respect and equality. I believe that these values will protect me in the future as I now know how to respond when someone wants to take advantage of me. I can now think rationally and consider the consequences of my cations.\n.\nI no longer believe that I am weak, neither do I feel the need to prove that I am strong by putting myself in unsafe situations. Now, I tell myself: I've been through this and I'm stronger than what I believed in\"\n.\n.\n.\n#hcsacommunityservices #dayspring #successstories #humansofsingapore #girlssupportgirls #empoweringwomen #girlssupportinggirls #charity #nonprofit #socialservice #testimonytuesday #truestory #communityservice #socialwork #motivation","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Community Chest Singapore","taggedUsername1":"comchestsg","taggedFullName2":"NCSS Singapore","taggedUsername2":"ncss.sg","taggedFullName3":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername3":"msfcares","taggedFullName4":"SG Cares","taggedUsername4":"singaporecares","id":"1963077268549391951_8227003110","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:11.754Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs0JBjOBzQS/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/mommyntrinity","username":"mommyntrinity","likeCount":180,"commentCount":54,"caption":"Photo by üíûTrinity and Mommyüá∏üá¨SGüíû in Singapore with @theasianparent, @singaporeschild, @moesingapore, @msfcares, and @ng.chee.meng.","pubDate":"2019-01-19T11:36:57.000Z","description":"Every parent feels proud of their child at some point.

We know as a startup like us, we will be embarking on a suicidal track if we are to compete against the big guns with their ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù. We decided to fall back to the 1Ô∏è‚É£st reason why I decided to kickstart @givevouchersg üéÅ. My life journey had allowed me to chance upon many different walks of lives of others. The last work experience had at times left me with a fair bit of emotional drain. Seeing how certain people can treat another fellow human being so differently leaves me with a bitter taste. I then decide to embark into creating a project that is simple, yet meaningful; which is to use gifting as an angle to provide happiness to others. It is which @givevouchersg üéÅ was created. Our tagline is ‚ÄúGive A Gift, Build A Story‚Äù. We hope to create more stories of happiness as a smile on one‚Äôs üòä is priceless. \nComing back to our 11/11 #GiftForGood campaign, It might not meant a lot to you or many of us, but this small gesture we are doing hopes to provide a smile to the faces of 100 families. We might not yet have the best deals, partners, resources on our platform for now. But I am proud that our team definitely won‚Äôt lose or even surpass what others are doing, that is we are true to our hearts to do what we have set upon. With this, I am hoping you can do a part to support our campaign, which you can help to brighten up 2 persons spirits; ie. the person who receive a digital gift & the person who will receive a meal voucher for your kind support! \nCheck @givevouchersg account now to find out how you can play a part!\n\n#GIVEvent #GiftAMeal #EachTransactionCounts #DoYourPart #1111deals #Target500 #pasiriscentrehawkercentre","location":"","locationId":"","type":"Photo","taggedFullName1":"Makansutra Singapore","taggedUsername1":"makansutrasingapore","taggedFullName2":"NTUC Singapore","taggedUsername2":"ntucsingapore","taggedFullName3":"Singapore Kindness Movement","taggedUsername3":"kindnesssg","taggedFullName4":"SINGAPORE HAWKERS","taggedUsername4":"singaporehawkers","taggedFullName5":"MSF Singapore","taggedUsername5":"msfcares","taggedFullName6":"Kopitiam","taggedUsername6":"kopitiam.sg","taggedFullName7":"Hawkers Food Street","taggedUsername7":"hawkersfoodstreet","taggedFullName8":"„ÄêÔªøÔºßÔº©Ôº∂Ôº•„ÄÄÔº°„ÄÄÔºßÔΩâÔΩÜÔΩîÔºå„ÄÄÔº¢ÔΩïÔΩâÔΩåÔΩÑ„ÄÄÔº°„ÄÄÔº≥ÔΩîÔΩèÔΩíÔΩô„Äë","taggedUsername8":"givevouchersg","taggedFullName9":"Samuel & Crystalbel","taggedUsername9":"sghawkerspots","taggedFullName10":"SG Hawker Eats","taggedUsername10":"sg_hawker_eats","taggedFullName11":"Hawkers: The Continuationüç¥","taggedUsername11":"thehawkerstory","taggedFullName12":"PasirRisCentralHawkerCentre","taggedUsername12":"pasirriscentralhawkercentre","id":"1910749000018352501_271096182","timestamp":"2022-03-22T12:48:13.561Z","query":"https://www.instagram.com/msfcares"},{"postUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo_wpWEnPt-/","profileUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/mommyntrinity","username":"mommyntrinity","likeCount":182,"commentCount":30,"caption":"Photo by üíûTrinity and Mommyüá∏üá¨SGüíû in Singapore with @msfcares.","pubDate":"2018-10-16T13:49:14.000Z","description":"I shook my Family Tree and a bunch of nuts fell out.
