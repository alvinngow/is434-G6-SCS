A self-funded service of Singapore Children’s Society, Tinkle Friend is a national toll-free helpline and chatline for all primary school students in Singapore. Tinkle Friend provides support, advice, and information to lonely and distressed children, especially in situations when their parents or main caregivers are unavailable. Trained staff and volunteers supporting the helpline and chatline operations guide children through problem-solving in a non-directive and caring approach.","['Advertisement', 'Poster', 'Flyer', 'Brochure', 'Paper', 'Text']",advertisement poster flyer brochure paper text,0.07547169811320754,0.0,0.03018867924528302,1,"['advertisement', 'poster', 'flyer', 'brochure', 'paper', 'text']",0.028571479,0.028571486,0.8853719,0.02857153,0.028913613

Our speakers highlighted that children who experience bullying often do not speak up or seek help. Instead, they may try to downplay it or even perform their daily tasks as though it didn't happen. This is a challenge that parents and caregivers, even professionals, commonly face because we may not know when is the best time to step in and if there is even a need for us to do so.

Hear from our Bully-Free team as they share strategies and practical handles on how to support children. In this age of smart phones and rise of social media, they also explore and share some insights into cyberbullying. #bullyfree

Regardless of the learning environment, be it at school or on the virtual realm, a child should feel safe as they grow. 

At Singapore Children’s Society, we run the Bully-Free programme that aims to build a safe and supportive school culture free from bullying. 

Tune in to the first of a 2-part series on bullying as professional speaking coach Benjamin Loh recounts his school bullying experiences and the negative impact it had on him.

So how do we still make sense and meaning of our own path, regardless of what it is? And how do we stick to following our own path?

Hear from our guest speaker Ms Faith Ng, Associate Artistic Director of @checkpointtheatre as she shares her journey of how she started out as a young writer, including the mistakes and discoveries she made along the way, and learn why it's important to hold true to who we are.

Prof Ho started volunteering with Singapore Children's Society in 1988; today he is the Society’s Deputy Chairman as well as the Chairman of our Research and Advocacy Standing Committee (RASC). 

Under Prof Ho's leadership, RASC is actively engaged in different aspects of work done on the prevention of child abuse and neglect in Singapore. The Singapore Children’s Society Lecture, inaugurated in 2007 to mark the Society’s 55th Anniversary Celebrations, was also Prof Ho’s brainchild. The annual lecture which features an expert speaker on a subject related to children, youth and families, reaches out to professionals working with children and families as well as to the members of the public.

Besides having dedicated more than 30 years to champion for the protection and well-being of children in Singapore, Prof Ho has also been an active volunteer in other aspects of work in Children’s Society. Sitting on multiple committees, he serves in the Human Resource and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee.

At a young age, Alisah* was separated from her parents due to their incarceration and has been living in Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society since then. Due to the separation, it created some resistance and anxiety in meeting her birth parents when they
were first released from prison. Over time, Alisah built up her trust with them, only to be disappointed when her parents got caught for taking drugs again. 

The adversities caused Alisah difficulties in keeping up with her studies and she developed maladaptive ways to cope with her struggles such as hitting her head against the wall. Despite the unfavourable family circumstances and various health concerns, Alisah showed great tenacity and resilience. With the help of care workers at Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society, she managed to cope better and developed good moral values. 

Help us to continue providing beneficiaries like Alisah, a safe and nurturing space to develop and grow. A donation of $50 can help cover the transportation costs for a child. Start impacting lives today (link in bio).

From birth, children would have received much care and attention from their parents. However not all children have the opportunity to⁣
grow up in a nurturing environment. John* was only 3 when he witnessed the arrest of his parents due to drug offences.⁣
⁣
As a little boy, he would look forward to the release of his parents hoping to have a complete family. However, his dreams were ⁣
short-lived as his parents continued with their addictions, leading to multiple incarcerations. Because of this, John suffered multiple placement breakdowns, moving from living with his family to his relatives, to a shelter for displaced families and finally to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society.⁣
⁣
Despite these difficult times, John persevered and remained resilient. His interest and talent in floorball kept him grounded as he focused his energy in it and as a result, was able to apply for the school of his choice via Direct School Admission.⁣
⁣
With just $90, you can help us to look after one beneficiary, like John for one month by sponsoring his meal costs. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Start impacting lives today (link in bio).

After a year in making, we present Signs, a song written and produced by our very own youth members from JYC @ Children’s Society (GIG @ JYC) to raise awareness on the need of seeking help when one experiences early signs of distress.

Through this music video, we hope to help listeners identify signs of distress and remind them that support can be found around them.

At the young age of 2, Shan* was admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society as her parents were unable to care for her due to drug addiction and depression issues. Her mother passed on when she was only 7 years old and Shan stayed on at Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society. 

Shan remained positive and disciplined in her school work, working hard as she aims to be an accountant in the future. She scored good grades in her preliminary examinations and strives to enrol in an accounting course in a local polytechnic. 

At Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society, we provide a temporary home for children and youth who have been abused or severely neglected to live in. They too, have the right to having their basic needs met just like their age peers. This includes going to school as usual and having pocket money to buy their meals.

Today also marks our first physical fundraising event (and a very socially distanced one!) – Tee Up for Our Children 🏑 – after one full year of cancelled events. All funds raised through this event will go towards running programmes at one of our service centres, JYC @ Children's Society - a community drop-in centre which focuses on engaging children and youth meaningfully to develop their strengths, build their self-confidence and pre-empt a path of juvenile delinquency. 

As one of our JYC members put it, ‘It is really more than just a centre. I can even call it my home after all my experiences here and the sense of belonging I have built in here.’ 

Help us keep our JYC family running for our current and future beneficiaries. Click the link in our bio to donate today!

Towards the end of last year, our residents gathered for an exciting Art of Speed challenge where they worked together to build a moving vehicle with recyclable materials such as toilet rolls and unused plastic cutlery as well as motors and batteries. Their vehicles were then put to a test to see if they could survive moving through a track that was filled with obstacles.

Through experiment and play, our residents had a lot of fun learning about physics as well as discovering new things about themselves and their friends such as their strengths and weaknesses!

&nbsp;&nbsp;
To raise awareness on the issue of bullying, Singapore Children’s Society has collaborated with the National Heritage Board to present Scribble Town, an interactive exhibition for children aged between 9 and 12. By embarking on a quest alongside characters Sam, Dan and Lydia, to save the fictional world of Scribble Town and bring colour back into their world, visitors will be prompted to reflect on their own experiences of bullying, whether they have been victims of bullying themselves or have acted in ways that count as bullying through the interactive elements at each station.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The exhibition is held at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall from now till 31 January 2021. SEE YOU THERE!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yet, many of these parenting resources are from the West, and some may even carry conflicting&nbsp;advice. How can parents decide which is the best way to raise their child?

This is part one of a three-part series containing the highlights of our 13th Singapore Children's Society Lecture that was delivered by Dr John M. Elliott on 12 October last year. Dr Elliott passed away on 13 December&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;He was&nbsp;an academic with a deep interest in the social and cognitive development of young&nbsp;children, and&nbsp;retired as the Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the National&nbsp;University of Singapore. Dr Elliott was a long-standing volunteer with Children’s&nbsp;Society, and&nbsp;served as the Chairman of its Research Committee for close to 20 years.

Being pregnant is not easy at all. It gets tougher when you have no income, your husband is incarcerated, and you are constantly on the move with no proper roof over your head. You have another child to feed too, but she ran away from home after failing PSLE. That was what Mdm Sara* experienced. 
At her wits' end, she turned to Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society where our social worker assisted with her finances and secured a HDB rental flat for her family. 
Mdm Sara would not have pulled through the difficult time without our social worker’s support. Feeling hopeful for the future, Mdm Sara said: “I have achieved more than what I expected.

Anger is one letter short of danger, and no one is more aware of that than 13-year-old Michael*.⁣
⁣
When Michael first walked into RoundBox @ Children’s Society, his explosive temperament led his head first into heated arguments with his peers. Through a journey of engagement and psychotherapeutic interventions, our social workers helped him develop various skills and methods for emotional management.⁣
⁣
Gradually, Michael developed patience, and went on to challenge himself in other programmes such as the music band. Some of his achievements include performing for President Halimah Yacob as the lead vocalist of the RoundBox band.⁣

Mdm Ang* felt the financial strain of having to provide for her two school-going sons after her husband, who was formerly the breadwinner for the family, lost his mobility through a terrible fall. She was alone in her efforts to secure their basic needs while she battled with her own health issues and excruciating pain to take on a labour-intensive job to pay the bills.⁣
⁣
Thankfully, she found help and advice through the social workers from Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society. Through the Centre’s assistance, Mdm Ang received financial assistance to support her children, and worked closely with our counsellors at Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society to alleviate her stress.⁣

It was a tumultuous time for Mr Joe*, a single father without a supportive family network, who only had the love from his children.⁣
⁣
Mr Joe made a wrong decision to borrow heavily from the loan sharks or illegal moneylenders, who hounded and left him scrambling to find a safe refuge for his children when he could not repay his debts. At wit’s end, Mr Joe sought help from Singapore Children’s Society. His children were admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society temporarily, and were protected from the harassment of the loan sharks while Mr Joe tried to clear his outstanding debts. Our staff members at Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society focused on caring for the children and worked closely with their school teachers and counsellor.⁣

With opportunities presented in the society, they make informed decisions that impact not only themselves, but their children too. Education plays a big part here.⁣
⁣
Mrs Tan* was a housewife dependent on her husband. However she divorced him as he was abusive and had to raise her seven children single-handedly. As she did not receive much education, she had trouble looking for a job to raise her children. At wit’s end, Mrs Tan turned to Yishun Family Service @ Children's Society for help.⁣
⁣
Thankfully, the social workers at the Centre helped her to apply for subsidies to support her children's education. They also equipped her with parenting and financial literacy skills. Since the Society’s inception, the programmes and services have evolved over time to support more children via avenues such as parenting help for single mothers, sexual abuse awareness and more.⁣

6-year-old Tim* is a resident of Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society. He comes from a single-parent family and his mother had returned to her home country to look after another family member. While he remained hopeful that his mother would return one day, he knew deep down that it would not happen so soon. Meanwhile, our social workers at the residential home worked hard to ensure that he does not miss out on education and a proper childhood.⁣
⁣
Help us, to help children like Tim to receive the love that they’ve always yearned for. Gift an Ang Bao this Chinese New Year so we can continue to care for more children alike.⁣

7-year-old Nina* and her younger siblings were often left to their own devices since young. Her father was retrenched and her mother suffered from depression. Thankfully, Nina and her siblings were referred to Student Care @ Children’s Society, where they received after school care in a nurturing environment.⁣
⁣
After she has graduated from the Centre, she returned as a volunteer to give back to our Society in hopes of impacting the lives of other children, like how our social workers have impacted hers.⁣

It warms our hearts to see children such as Nina, who wants to carry on the spirit of love. This motivates us to do even better at our craft. #givingback⁣

Tinkle Friend Helpline (1800 2744 788), a national toll-free helpline for primary school children, was first introduced to children who needed a listening ear in November 1984. In 2014, we started providing Tinkle Friend Online Chat service (www.tinklefriend.com) to children as we evolved with technology. Manned by trained staff and volunteers, both services provide support, advice and information to lonely and distressed children especially when their parents or main caregivers are unavailable. 
Beaten by her parents and bullied by her elder brother, nine-year-old Jenny* felt alone and unloved. She turned to the web, and found comfort in Tinkle Friend, who was willing to listen and give her support and advice. Jenny was eventually referred to her school counsellor, and was grateful for the help rendered. 
There may be many more Jennys out there who need our help. Help us today so that we can change someone’s tomorrow.

Our social worker Kate Ofiaza, from Family Service Centre (Yishun) has recently helped a family regain financial independence, after the family encountered difficulties making ends meet. Having approached the Centre for help, Kate rendered emotional support and ad-hoc food rations for Alinah’s family, equipped Alinah with problem solving and stress management skills, strategised a plan for clearing her debts, motivated her to provide emotional support to her husband, linked Alinah with job fairs and provided school pocket money fund for her daughter. After receiving help and being re-employed in December last year, Alinah’s family has now regained financial independence, and is able to manage their finances more effectively.

Some commonly seen negative peer pressure include grouping together to ostracise particular classmates or going after the latest gadgets in order to feel belonged to a group. On the other hand, positive peer pressure can include influencing the child to study together or encouraging the child to help the less fortunate by participating in voluntary work. 
Share with us how you think parents can support their children in dealing with negative peer pressure!

Our youth beneficiaries found their place to relax at Youth Centre (Jurong). “I feel happy because I can ‘chill’ with friends and participate in many fun activities,” says Teck Siang, 17, who is a member at our Youth Centre (Jurong). “The staff at the Centre helped me to become more confident, caring and helpful.” Fellow youth member, Hanis, 17, adds that the friends he made at the Centre draws him to keep coming back. 
We wish you all a happy Youth Day!
