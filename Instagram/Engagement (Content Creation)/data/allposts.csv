To raise awareness about water conservation, our youth beneficiaries from JYC @ Children’s Society teamed up with senior rowers from SG Dragons to clean up Lower Seletar Reservoir on 16 March.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CbHbKk2rDGb/,"It is World Social Work Day today! We invited Ms Tan Bee Joo, Senior Director and Group Lead of Family Services to share more about her 24-year journey with Singapore Children’s Society.
 
In her starting years, she was involved with casework and counselling for low-income families and had also worked with youth in Project CABIN – drop-in centres in secondary schools for students to have a conducive environment to hangout after school hours. She led projects such as the Bully Free programme and Tinkle Friend as she took on a managerial role, and today, she continues to serve vulnerable families and their children in the Yishun community.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CaEbojdqpGj/,"“Don’t tell anyone, this is our secret,” is a phrase often used by perpetrators so that they can continue to commit sexual acts with children. Hence it is important to teach children the N.O.T. rules – to say No, walk Out, and Tell a trusted adult if they encounter a bad touch or inappropriate action.

Watch this short animation clip with your child and observe how April applies the N.O.T. rules in this unsafe situation.

They also suggested tips for children and their parents/caregivers to ensure safe, engaging, and positive online experiences. 

Happy Safer Internet Day!

The seeds for SCC were sown in the late 1970s when then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew expressed concern about “latchkey children” – children who typically wore their house keys around their necks so they could let themselves into their homes after school. These children often returned to empty houses, and fended for themselves until their parents returned from work.

Through the decades, the Student Care service model has evolved with greater emphasis on supporting children from disadvantaged families with school-based student care. This is now available in almost all primary schools. The Ministry of Education is also expanding the After School Engagement programmes for both primary and secondary school students. Within Bukit Merah, many community agencies also provide similar services through their student care centres. This allows us to shift our focus to other needed programmes. We will work with community agencies to explore how we can continue to support the children and young persons living in the area in other ways.

On behalf of all past and present beneficiaries, thank you to the staff and volunteers who have kept the centre going for over four decades, and created fond memories to last a lifetime! ✨",1,93,2021-12-30T07:00:06.000Z,,true,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,sgchildrensoc,Singapore Children's Society,https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/270255688_952374502365448_2168668910566200608_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=qaJtLGe8kiEAX9I7r2c&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-UPc7i1gvaYzGolyGEGC_0pzIFaF0DNkNG_L6_mqyd-Q&oe=6251B5DE&_nc_sid=86f79a,2739950761733641191,2022-04-04T16:29:52.113Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Project Hope & Smiles is created to remind us how giving back can be done in many ways, & how it can translate into love, hope & smiles for others.

May this video of our chat with a couple of our volunteers of Singapore Children’s Society inspire you like it did to us ✨ Through donation, fundraising or volunteering – we have the same goal in mind: To put hope and smiles in the hearts of our children, youth and families in need.

Please support us in making that positive difference to the lives of those we are caring for. 

To donate & find out more, visit: bit.ly/hopeandsmiles_ or click the link in our bio 😊 

Take that step to give back and bring hope & smiles to others today!

https://www.instagram.com/p/CWFkXaaruYO/,"In the last episode, we spoke about school bullying and the impact it can have on children. Our speakers highlighted that children who experience bullying often do not speak up or seek help. Instead, they may try to downplay it or even perform their daily tasks as though it didn't happen. This is a challenge that parents and caregivers, even professionals, commonly face because we may not know when is the best time to step in and if there is even a need for us to do so.

Hear from our Bully-Free team as they share strategies and practical handles on how to support children. In this age of smart phones and rise of social media, they also explore and share some insights into cyberbullying. #bullyfree

It is commemorated by UNESCO Member States every first Thursday of November each year. Regardless of the learning environment, be it at school or on the virtual realm, a child should feel safe as they grow. 

At Singapore Children’s Society, we run the Bully-Free programme that aims to build a safe and supportive school culture free from bullying. 

Tune in to the first of a 2-part series on bullying as professional speaking coach Benjamin Loh recounts his school bullying experiences and the negative impact it had on him. He is joined by Children’s Society’s Bully-Free team, as they share about the types of bullying and how to spot some of the warning signs. #bullyfree

In an interview with @zaobaosg, Singapore Children’s Society’s volunteers Mdm Sarasa Seshadri and Ms Celine Tay shared about the Vulnerable Witness Support Programme (VWSP), a programme coordinated by Children’s Society with the State Courts and Family Justice Courts to provide emotional, non-evidentiary practical support to vulnerable child witnesses under the age of 18 who have to testify in criminal cases. They also shared key takeaways from their years of volunteering and strategies they use to lift the spirits of the child witnesses amidst the long court processes.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CSY6rbqswb8/,"Our heartiest congratulations to our Deputy Chairman Prof Ho Lai Yun for being conferred the Public Service Star (Bar) for this year's National Day Awards! Prof Ho started volunteering with Singapore Children's Society in 1988; today he is the Society’s Deputy Chairman as well as the Chairman of our Research and Advocacy Standing Committee (RASC). 

Under Prof Ho's leadership, RASC is actively engaged in different aspects of work done on the prevention of child abuse and neglect in Singapore. The Singapore Children’s Society Lecture, inaugurated in 2007 to mark the Society’s 55th Anniversary Celebrations, was also Prof Ho’s brainchild. The annual lecture which features an expert speaker on a subject related to children, youth and families, reaches out to professionals working with children and families as well as to the members of the public.

Besides having dedicated more than 30 years to champion for the protection and well-being of children in Singapore, Prof Ho has also been an active volunteer in other aspects of work in Children’s Society. Sitting on multiple committees, he serves in the Human Resource and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee. He is also the Deputy Chairman of the Crisis Management Committee and the Chairman of the Awards Committee for the Singapore Children’s Society Awards, which formally recognises volunteers and donors for their dedication and generosity.

At a young age, Alisah* was separated from her parents due to their incarceration and has been living in Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society since then. Due to the separation, it created some resistance and anxiety in meeting her birth parents when they
were first released from prison. Over time, Alisah built up her trust with them, only to be disappointed when her parents got caught for taking drugs again. 

The adversities caused Alisah difficulties in keeping up with her studies and she developed maladaptive ways to cope with her struggles such as hitting her head against the wall. Despite the unfavourable family circumstances and various health concerns, Alisah showed great tenacity and resilience. With the help of care workers at Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society, she managed to cope better and developed good moral values. 

Help us to continue providing beneficiaries like Alisah, a safe and nurturing space to develop and grow. A donation of $50 can help cover the transportation costs for a child. Start impacting lives today (link in bio).

From birth, children would have received much care and attention from their parents. However not all children have the opportunity to⁣
grow up in a nurturing environment. John* was only 3 when he witnessed the arrest of his parents due to drug offences.⁣
⁣
As a little boy, he would look forward to the release of his parents hoping to have a complete family. However, his dreams were ⁣
short-lived as his parents continued with their addictions, leading to multiple incarcerations. Because of this, John suffered multiple placement breakdowns, moving from living with his family to his relatives, to a shelter for displaced families and finally to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society.⁣
⁣
Despite these difficult times, John persevered and remained resilient. His interest and talent in floorball kept him grounded as he focused his energy in it and as a result, was able to apply for the school of his choice via Direct School Admission.⁣
⁣
With just $90, you can help us to look after one beneficiary, like John for one month by sponsoring his meal costs. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Start impacting lives today (link in bio).

After a year in making, we present Signs, a song written and produced by our very own youth members from JYC @ Children’s Society (GIG @ JYC) to raise awareness on the need of seeking help when one experiences early signs of distress.

Through this music video, we hope to help listeners identify signs of distress and remind them that support can be found around them. 

A quick shout-out to Leonard from the @snakeweedstudios  for making this possible through your help with the song’s recording!

At the young age of 2, Shan* was admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society as her parents were unable to care for her due to drug addiction and depression issues. Her mother passed on when she was only 7 years old and Shan stayed on at Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society. 

Shan remained positive and disciplined in her school work, working hard as she aims to be an accountant in the future. She scored good grades in her preliminary examinations and strives to enrol in an accounting course in a local polytechnic. 

At Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society, we provide a temporary home for children and youth who have been abused or severely neglected to live in. They too, have the right to having their basic needs met just like their age peers. This includes going to school as usual and having pocket money to buy their meals.

With just $45, you’ll help us to look after one beneficiary, like Shan for one month by paying towards her school pocket money. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Click the link in our bio to start impacting lives today.

Today also marks our first physical fundraising event (and a very socially distanced one!) – Tee Up for Our Children 🏑 – after one full year of cancelled events. All funds raised through this event will go towards running programmes at one of our service centres, JYC @ Children's Society - a community drop-in centre which focuses on engaging children and youth meaningfully to develop their strengths, build their self-confidence and pre-empt a path of juvenile delinquency. 

As one of our JYC members put it, ‘It is really more than just a centre. I can even call it my home after all my experiences here and the sense of belonging I have built in here.’ 

Help us keep our JYC family running for our current and future beneficiaries. Click the link in our bio to donate today!

To raise awareness on the issue of bullying, Singapore Children’s Society has collaborated with the National Heritage Board to present Scribble Town, an interactive exhibition for children aged between 9 and 12. The exhibition held at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall ends this 31 January so make your way down if you have yet to!

https://www.instagram.com/p/CIF0WXWgpJe/,"#Fact: The number of applications for financial assistance has doubled and the funds disbursed under Singapore Children’s Society’s Casework Fund almost tripled this year compared to last year. 

Our Casework Fund provides financial assistance to needy families so that they can pay for meals, daily necessities, children’s school expenses etc. Help our beneficiaries by donating to our Virtual Flag Day campaign. All donations raised will go towards the Society’s Casework Fund and any unused Casework Fund donations will be carried over to 2021 and beyond so that we can continue to extend a lifeline to as many families in need.

All donations raised from the Virtual Flag Day campaign will go towards our Casework Fund which provides financial assistance to needy families.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Counsellors Maathavan and Randee from the Bully-Free team recently dropped by @f45_training_jurongcbd to share tips with the trainers on how to identify bullying behaviour and how they can prevent and manage such behaviours.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is an inaugural partnership as @f45_training_jurongcbd is looking at expanding its range of classes with F45 Prodigy, a class that is specifically for youth aged 11 to 17. It was a very engaging and fruitful sharing session, and the Bully-Free team looks forward to more community collaborations in the future!&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Counsellors Maathavan and Randee from the Bully-Free team recently dropped by @f45_training_jurongcbd to share tips with the trainers on how to identify bullying behaviour and how they can prevent and manage such behaviours.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is an inaugural partnership as @f45_training_jurongcbd is looking at expanding its range of classes with F45 Prodigy, a class that is specifically for youth aged 11 to 17. It was a very engaging and fruitful sharing session, and the Bully-Free team looks forward to more community collaborations in the future!&nbsp;

To raise awareness on the issue of bullying, Singapore Children’s Society has collaborated with the National Heritage Board to present Scribble Town, an interactive exhibition for children aged between 9 and 12. By embarking on a quest alongside characters Sam, Dan and Lydia, to save the fictional world of Scribble Town and bring colour back into their world, visitors will be prompted to reflect on their own experiences of bullying, whether they have been victims of bullying themselves or have acted in ways that count as bullying through the interactive elements at each station.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The exhibition is held at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall from now till 31 January 2021. SEE YOU THERE!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Did you know that there are children of pre-school age who do not receive the education they need to build a strong foundation in their learning journeys? In this video, our counsellor Joanne tells us why pre-school education is important, and how we reach out to families in need so that their children do not miss out on pre-school education as a result of their circumstances. 

Please donate generously to support our programmes and services, including pre-school outreach, that seek to protect and nurture children and youth of all races and religions❤️.

However, coping with anger can be challenging for some children, leading to behavioural outbursts or disruptive behaviours. Moreover, the many changes caused by the ongoing pandemic may pose greater challenges for children to cope with their emotions.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9TlTBkn0uc/,"Parenting resources commonly regard the idea of parental warmth as an important part of a parent-child relationship. But does parental warmth equate parental concern? In this video, Prof Elliott unpacks the difference between the&nbsp;two, and uncovers a distinct trait of Asian and Western parents.

This is part two of a three-part series containing the highlights of our 13th Singapore Children's Society Lecture that was delivered by Dr John M. Elliott on 12 October last year. Dr Elliott passed away on 13 December&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;He was&nbsp;an academic with a deep interest in the social and cognitive development of young&nbsp;children, and&nbsp;retired as the Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at&nbsp;the National University of Singapore. Dr Elliott was a long-standing volunteer with Children’s&nbsp;Society, and&nbsp;served as the Chairman of its Research Committee for close&nbsp;to 20 years.

Being pregnant is not easy at all. It gets tougher when you have no income, your husband is incarcerated, and you are constantly on the move with no proper roof over your head. You have another child to feed too, but she ran away from home after failing PSLE. That was what Mdm Sara* experienced. 
At her wits' end, she turned to Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society where our social worker assisted with her finances and secured a HDB rental flat for her family. 
Mdm Sara would not have pulled through the difficult time without our social worker’s support. Feeling hopeful for the future, Mdm Sara said: “I have achieved more than what I expected. Thank you, Singapore Children’s Society.” *Name has been changed to protect the identity of our beneficiary.",1,45,2020-02-11T06:30:22.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,sgchildrensoc,Singapore Children's Society,https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/83682721_512898619608604_3113865688345461336_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=qsWlEJyGzxwAX9vTVG0&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-T2xEnaazHaqrgM4dx6JjtMbmg9R03Zd9LufcwGgZrpg&oe=62527661&_nc_sid=86f79a,2241290062947924053,2022-04-04T16:30:07.266Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.instagram.com/p/B339v0wHfIs/,"The #livebelowtheline&nbsp;challenge has taught us first-hand how mentally draining shopping on a shoestring budget can be. A tight budget is an everyday reality for&nbsp;some of our beneficiaries. A family of six we know reports their grocery budget to be $600 a month. That comes down to $3.33 per person a day, or $0.70 over our challenge budget. This means that the family often&nbsp;has&nbsp;to&nbsp;choose between paying for utilities or food.

We’ve begun having deeper conversations with our beneficiaries about their food budgets. “How do you do it? That’s a tight budget! What do you buy?”, we would ask. Eventually they share they do spend a little over what they usually&nbsp;report (hence arrears in utilities) but they dare not report a higher number when asking for assistance. They share that sometimes they are embarrassed or worried about a reporting a higher number when are asked why they ‘overspend’. We cannot help but wonder.

Despite there being numerous parenting perspectives, Dr Elliott feels that parents should not simply subscribe to any one school of thought or be overly hung up on the labels of ""east"" and ""west"", slogans or teachings. Read the full Lianhe Zaobao interview at https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/fukan/family/story20190916-989404

Anger is one letter short of danger, and no one is more aware of that than 13-year-old Michael*.⁣
⁣
When Michael first walked into RoundBox @ Children’s Society, his explosive temperament led his head first into heated arguments with his peers. Through a journey of engagement and psychotherapeutic interventions, our social workers helped him develop various skills and methods for emotional management.⁣
⁣
Gradually, Michael developed patience, and went on to challenge himself in other programmes such as the music band. Some of his achievements include performing for President Halimah Yacob as the lead vocalist of the RoundBox band.⁣

In line with their annual Sports Day, #BBSS conducted a #fundraising walk - “No Shoe Day”, at Clementi Stadium on 26 April 2019 to raise funds for Singapore Children’s Society! As the name suggests, both students and teachers removed their shoes and went through obstacles such as acupressure mats while donating to the various collection boxes carried by student fundraisers. This event is one of the many holistic activities that the school engages, to #giveback to the community.⁣

Mdm Ang* felt the financial strain of having to provide for her two school-going sons after her husband, who was formerly the breadwinner for the family, lost his mobility through a terrible fall. She was alone in her efforts to secure their basic needs while she battled with her own health issues and excruciating pain to take on a labour-intensive job to pay the bills.⁣
⁣
Thankfully, she found help and advice through the social workers from Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society. Through the Centre’s assistance, Mdm Ang received financial assistance to support her children, and worked closely with our counsellors at Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society to alleviate her stress.⁣

It was a tumultuous time for Mr Joe*, a single father without a supportive family network, who only had the love from his children.⁣
⁣
Mr Joe made a wrong decision to borrow heavily from the loan sharks or illegal moneylenders, who hounded and left him scrambling to find a safe refuge for his children when he could not repay his debts. At wit’s end, Mr Joe sought help from Singapore Children’s Society. His children were admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society temporarily, and were protected from the harassment of the loan sharks while Mr Joe tried to clear his outstanding debts. Our staff members at Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society focused on caring for the children and worked closely with their school teachers and counsellor.⁣
⁣
On Good Friday, give an act of love by donating to support children, youth and families in need. Help them now >> https://1000p.org.sg/get-involved⁣

Besides organising fun-filled activities, the youth workers also conduct life skills workshops and training courses, as well as provide emotional support for students in need.",0,50,2019-04-06T04:29:42.000Z,,true,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,sgchildrensoc,Singapore Children's Society,https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/54429338_374576906480168_3005694429402023372_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=4JbGoS43p-sAX-w5dQv&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-odli50ih68NobVavbxy9fjYRt9acuVkhFt6A297Ac5Q&oe=6253003E&_nc_sid=86f79a,2015824110407674896,2022-04-04T16:30:14.961Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,,,,,,,,,,,Meridian Secondary School,1843464799277191

https://www.instagram.com/p/Buuv8FVhAk8/,"It takes women from every level of the society to create a balanced environment that fosters growth for all. With opportunities presented in the society, they make informed decisions that impact not only themselves, but their children too. Education plays a big part here.⁣
⁣
Mrs Tan* was a housewife dependent on her husband. However she divorced him as he was abusive and had to raise her seven children single-handedly. As she did not receive much education, she had trouble looking for a job to raise her children. At wit’s end, Mrs Tan turned to Yishun Family Service @ Children's Society for help.⁣
⁣
Thankfully, the social workers at the Centre helped her to apply for subsidies to support her children's education. They also equipped her with parenting and financial literacy skills. Since the Society’s inception, the programmes and services have evolved over time to support more children via avenues such as parenting help for single mothers, sexual abuse awareness and more.⁣

Our social workers and counsellors engage daily with the youth, building up trust and rapport between them. This helps them open up and share with us their challenges and difficulties they are facing. Through this engagement process, our staff are then able to provide the necessary intervention to them.⁣

6-year-old Tim* is a resident of Sunbeam Place @ Children’s Society. He comes from a single-parent family and his mother had returned to her home country to look after another family member. While he remained hopeful that his mother would return one day, he knew deep down that it would not happen so soon. Meanwhile, our social workers at the residential home worked hard to ensure that he does not miss out on education and a proper childhood.⁣
⁣
Help us, to help children like Tim to receive the love that they’ve always yearned for. Gift an Ang Bao this Chinese New Year so we can continue to care for more children alike.⁣

7-year-old Nina* and her younger siblings were often left to their own devices since young. Her father was retrenched and her mother suffered from depression. Thankfully, Nina and her siblings were referred to Student Care @ Children’s Society, where they received after school care in a nurturing environment.⁣
⁣
After she has graduated from the Centre, she returned as a volunteer to give back to our Society in hopes of impacting the lives of other children, like how our social workers have impacted hers.⁣
⁣
It warms our hearts to see children such as Nina, who wants to carry on the spirit of love. This motivates us to do even better at our craft. #givingback⁣

https://www.instagram.com/p/BbQsEjPAhqr/,"65th Anniversary #Throwback: Do you know, our bubbly blue friend Tinkle Friend has turned 33? Tinkle Friend Helpline (1800 2744 788), a national toll-free helpline for primary school children, was first introduced to children who needed a listening ear in November 1984. In 2014, we started providing Tinkle Friend Online Chat service (www.tinklefriend.com) to children as we evolved with technology. Manned by trained staff and volunteers, both services provide support, advice and information to lonely and distressed children especially when their parents or main caregivers are unavailable. 
Beaten by her parents and bullied by her elder brother, nine-year-old Jenny* felt alone and unloved. She turned to the web, and found comfort in Tinkle Friend, who was willing to listen and give her support and advice. Jenny was eventually referred to her school counsellor, and was grateful for the help rendered. 
There may be many more Jennys out there who need our help. Help us today so that we can change someone’s tomorrow.

1. Give yourself 3 compliments in a day!
2. List 3 things in your day which made you happy!
3. Get active in a sport!
4. Surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are!
5. Tell someone if you need help!

Our social worker Kate Ofiaza, from Family Service Centre (Yishun) has recently helped a family regain financial independence, after the family encountered difficulties making ends meet. Having approached the Centre for help, Kate rendered emotional support and ad-hoc food rations for Alinah’s family, equipped Alinah with problem solving and stress management skills, strategised a plan for clearing her debts, motivated her to provide emotional support to her husband, linked Alinah with job fairs and provided school pocket money fund for her daughter. After receiving help and being re-employed in December last year, Alinah’s family has now regained financial independence, and is able to manage their finances more effectively.

Kudos to Kate for extending her help!

https://www.instagram.com/p/-u4ur9mUQM/,"Peer influence and peer pressure can be both positive and negative. Some commonly seen negative peer pressure include grouping together to ostracise particular classmates or going after the latest gadgets in order to feel belonged to a group. On the other hand, positive peer pressure can include influencing the child to study together or encouraging the child to help the less fortunate by participating in voluntary work. 
Share with us how you think parents can support their children in dealing with negative peer pressure!

Rewarding your children can reinforce positive behaviours in them and to make them feel good about themselves! One way of rewarding is to do so verbally such as praising them for their good behaviour. For example, give recognition when they assist in clearing the dishes together with you after meal times.

Share with us on the ways you reward your children! 😄

https://www.instagram.com/p/6T-Nu-GUUE/,"“I first saw this bird at Jurong Bird Park. I liked the vulture and decided to draw it.” Many children aspire to become the King of the Sky, like young artist Tyler Tan. Unfortunately, some children may not fulfill their aspirations and need help to rebuild their lives after suffering from abuse.

Tyler plays his part for the children in need by contributing his talent in the OCBC-TODAY Children’s Fund Art Exhibition – and you can contribute too.
