The seeds for SCC were sown in the late 1970s when then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew expressed concern about ‚Äúlatchkey children‚Äù ‚Äì children who typically wore their house keys around their necks so they could let themselves into their homes after school.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CWFkXaaruYO/,"In the last episode, we spoke about school bullying and the impact it can have on children. Our speakers highlighted that children who experience bullying often do not speak up or seek help. Instead, they may try to downplay it or even perform their daily tasks as though it didn't happen. This is a challenge that parents and caregivers, even professionals, commonly face because we may not know when is the best time to step in and if there is even a need for us to do so.

Hear from our Bully-Free team as they share strategies and practical handles on how to support children. In this age of smart phones and rise of social media, they also explore and share some insights into cyberbullying. #bullyfree

Prof Ho started volunteering with Singapore Children's Society in 1988; today he is the Society‚Äôs Deputy Chairman as well as the Chairman of our Research and Advocacy Standing Committee (RASC). 

Under Prof Ho's leadership, RASC is actively engaged in different aspects of work done on the prevention of child abuse and neglect in Singapore. The Singapore Children‚Äôs Society Lecture, inaugurated in 2007 to mark the Society‚Äôs 55th Anniversary Celebrations, was also Prof Ho‚Äôs brainchild. The annual lecture which features an expert speaker on a subject related to children, youth and families, reaches out to professionals working with children and families as well as to the members of the public.

Besides having dedicated more than 30 years to champion for the protection and well-being of children in Singapore, Prof Ho has also been an active volunteer in other aspects of work in Children‚Äôs Society. Sitting on multiple committees, he serves in the Human Resource and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee. He is also the Deputy Chairman of the Crisis Management Committee and the Chairman of the Awards Committee for the Singapore Children‚Äôs Society Awards, which formally recognises volunteers and donors for their dedication and generosity.

At a young age, Alisah* was separated from her parents due to their incarceration and has been living in Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society since then. Due to the separation, it created some resistance and anxiety in meeting her birth parents when they
were first released from prison. Over time, Alisah built up her trust with them, only to be disappointed when her parents got caught for taking drugs again. 

The adversities caused Alisah difficulties in keeping up with her studies and she developed maladaptive ways to cope with her struggles such as hitting her head against the wall. Despite the unfavourable family circumstances and various health concerns, Alisah showed great tenacity and resilience. With the help of care workers at Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society, she managed to cope better and developed good moral values. 

Help us to continue providing beneficiaries like Alisah, a safe and nurturing space to develop and grow. A donation of $50 can help cover the transportation costs for a child. Start impacting lives today (link in bio).

From birth, children would have received much care and attention from their parents. However not all children have the opportunity to‚Å£
grow up in a nurturing environment. John* was only 3 when he witnessed the arrest of his parents due to drug offences.‚Å£
‚Å£
As a little boy, he would look forward to the release of his parents hoping to have a complete family. However, his dreams were ‚Å£
short-lived as his parents continued with their addictions, leading to multiple incarcerations. Because of this, John suffered multiple placement breakdowns, moving from living with his family to his relatives, to a shelter for displaced families and finally to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society.‚Å£
‚Å£
Despite these difficult times, John persevered and remained resilient. His interest and talent in floorball kept him grounded as he focused his energy in it and as a result, was able to apply for the school of his choice via Direct School Admission.‚Å£
‚Å£
With just $90, you can help us to look after one beneficiary, like John for one month by sponsoring his meal costs. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Start impacting lives today (link in bio).

After a year in making, we present Signs, a song written and produced by our very own youth members from JYC @ Children‚Äôs Society (GIG @ JYC) to raise awareness on the need of seeking help when one experiences early signs of distress.

Through this music video, we hope to help listeners identify signs of distress and remind them that support can be found around them. 

A quick shout-out to Leonard from the @snakeweedstudios  for making this possible through your help with the song‚Äôs recording!

At the young age of 2, Shan* was admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society as her parents were unable to care for her due to drug addiction and depression issues. Her mother passed on when she was only 7 years old and Shan stayed on at Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society. 

Shan remained positive and disciplined in her school work, working hard as she aims to be an accountant in the future. She scored good grades in her preliminary examinations and strives to enrol in an accounting course in a local polytechnic. 

At Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society, we provide a temporary home for children and youth who have been abused or severely neglected to live in. They too, have the right to having their basic needs met just like their age peers. This includes going to school as usual and having pocket money to buy their meals.

With just $45, you‚Äôll help us to look after one beneficiary, like Shan for one month by paying towards her school pocket money. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Click the link in our bio to start impacting lives today.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
To raise awareness on the issue of bullying, Singapore Children‚Äôs Society has collaborated with the National Heritage Board to present Scribble Town, an interactive exhibition for children aged between 9 and 12. By embarking on a quest alongside characters Sam, Dan and Lydia, to save the fictional world of Scribble Town and bring colour back into their world, visitors will be prompted to reflect on their own experiences of bullying, whether they have been victims of bullying themselves or have acted in ways that count as bullying through the interactive elements at each station.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The exhibition is held at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall from now till 31 January 2021. SEE YOU THERE!&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;
To raise awareness on the issue of bullying, Singapore Children‚Äôs Society has collaborated with the National Heritage Board to present Scribble Town, an interactive exhibition for children aged between 9 and 12. By embarking on a quest alongside characters Sam, Dan and Lydia, to save the fictional world of Scribble Town and bring colour back into their world, visitors will be prompted to reflect on their own experiences of bullying, whether they have been victims of bullying themselves or have acted in ways that count as bullying through the interactive elements at each station.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The exhibition is held at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall from now till 31 January 2021. SEE YOU THERE!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Did you know that there are children of pre-school age who do not receive the education they need to build a strong foundation in their learning journeys? In this video, our counsellor Joanne tells us why pre-school education is important, and how we reach out to families in need so that their children do not miss out on pre-school education as a result of their circumstances.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9TlTBkn0uc/,"Parenting resources commonly regard the idea of parental warmth as an important part of a parent-child relationship. But does parental warmth equate parental concern? In this video, Prof Elliott unpacks the difference between the&nbsp;two, and uncovers a distinct trait of Asian and Western parents.

This is part two of a three-part series containing the highlights of our 13th Singapore Children's Society Lecture that was delivered by Dr John M. Elliott on 12 October last year. Dr Elliott passed away on 13 December&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;He was&nbsp;an academic with a deep interest in the social and cognitive development of young&nbsp;children, and&nbsp;retired as the Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at&nbsp;the National University of Singapore. Dr Elliott was a long-standing volunteer with Children‚Äôs&nbsp;Society, and&nbsp;served as the Chairman of its Research Committee for close&nbsp;to 20 years.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Bi-9QnEdx/,"Every parent wants to raise their children well. They seek tips in different resources, ranging from online parenting articles to parenting books. Yet, many of these parenting resources are from the West, and some may even carry conflicting&nbsp;advice. How can parents decide which is the best way to raise their child?

This is part one of a three-part series containing the highlights of our 13th Singapore Children's Society Lecture that was delivered by Dr John M. Elliott on 12 October last year. Dr Elliott passed away on 13 December&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;He was&nbsp;an academic with a deep interest in the social and cognitive development of young&nbsp;children, and&nbsp;retired as the Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the National&nbsp;University of Singapore. Dr Elliott was a long-standing volunteer with Children‚Äôs&nbsp;Society, and&nbsp;served as the Chairman of its Research Committee for close to 20 years.

Being pregnant is not easy at all. It gets tougher when you have no income, your husband is incarcerated, and you are constantly on the move with no proper roof over your head. You have another child to feed too, but she ran away from home after failing PSLE. That was what Mdm Sara* experienced. 
At her wits' end, she turned to Yishun Family Service @ Children‚Äôs Society where our social worker assisted with her finances and secured a HDB rental flat for her family. 
Mdm Sara would not have pulled through the difficult time without our social worker‚Äôs support. Feeling hopeful for the future, Mdm Sara said: ‚ÄúI have achieved more than what I expected.

These events are shocking, often without warning. Quality of life dips fast and the hope of returning to normal life can be distant. The adjustment can be emotionally difficult for these beneficiaries.

Despite there being numerous parenting perspectives, Dr Elliott feels that parents should not simply subscribe to any one school of thought or be overly hung up on the labels of ""east"" and ""west"", slogans or teachings. Read the full Lianhe Zaobao interview at https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/fukan/family/story20190916-989404

Anger is one letter short of danger, and no one is more aware of that than 13-year-old Michael*.‚Å£
‚Å£
When Michael first walked into RoundBox @ Children‚Äôs Society, his explosive temperament led his head first into heated arguments with his peers. Through a journey of engagement and psychotherapeutic interventions, our social workers helped him develop various skills and methods for emotional management.‚Å£
‚Å£
Gradually, Michael developed patience, and went on to challenge himself in other programmes such as the music band. Some of his achievements include performing for President Halimah Yacob as the lead vocalist of the RoundBox band.‚Å£

This Youth Day, we rejoice in the dreams, passions and talents of all youth, regardless of who they are.‚Å£

Mdm Ang* felt the financial strain of having to provide for her two school-going sons after her husband, who was formerly the breadwinner for the family, lost his mobility through a terrible fall. She was alone in her efforts to secure their basic needs while she battled with her own health issues and excruciating pain to take on a labour-intensive job to pay the bills.‚Å£
‚Å£
Thankfully, she found help and advice through the social workers from Yishun Family Service @ Children‚Äôs Society. Through the Centre‚Äôs assistance, Mdm Ang received financial assistance to support her children, and worked closely with our counsellors at Yishun Family Service @ Children‚Äôs Society to alleviate her stress.‚Å£

It was a tumultuous time for Mr Joe*, a single father without a supportive family network, who only had the love from his children.‚Å£
‚Å£
Mr Joe made a wrong decision to borrow heavily from the loan sharks or illegal moneylenders, who hounded and left him scrambling to find a safe refuge for his children when he could not repay his debts. At wit‚Äôs end, Mr Joe sought help from Singapore Children‚Äôs Society. His children were admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society temporarily, and were protected from the harassment of the loan sharks while Mr Joe tried to clear his outstanding debts. Our staff members at Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society focused on caring for the children and worked closely with their school teachers and counsellor.‚Å£

It is a good sharing session about the Society and also experiencing what @vox.44cc does.‚Äù",0,43,2019-03-21T03:00:23.000Z,,true,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,sgchildrensoc,Singapore Children's Society,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/53848000_137098840677197_183929125806794824_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=LjRUXxpKVfYAX-K8waU&tn=np9cglJokbU76B4C&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT9rCukohdbyFtAMRpnWcrnOSJtPYEceE5TQHCqQjq7okw&oe=623F6AC0&_nc_sid=86f79a,2004182740735789688,2022-03-22T04:33:46.541Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgchildrensoc/,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.instagram.com/p/Buuv8FVhAk8/,"It takes women from every level of the society to create a balanced environment that fosters growth for all. With opportunities presented in the society, they make informed decisions that impact not only themselves, but their children too. Education plays a big part here.‚Å£
‚Å£
Mrs Tan* was a housewife dependent on her husband. However she divorced him as he was abusive and had to raise her seven children single-handedly. As she did not receive much education, she had trouble looking for a job to raise her children. At wit‚Äôs end, Mrs Tan turned to Yishun Family Service @ Children's Society for help.‚Å£
‚Å£
Thankfully, the social workers at the Centre helped her to apply for subsidies to support her children's education. They also equipped her with parenting and financial literacy skills. Since the Society‚Äôs inception, the programmes and services have evolved over time to support more children via avenues such as parenting help for single mothers, sexual abuse awareness and more.‚Å£

‚Å£
6-year-old Tim* is a resident of Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society. He comes from a single-parent family and his mother had returned to her home country to look after another family member. While he remained hopeful that his mother would return one day, he knew deep down that it would not happen so soon. Meanwhile, our social workers at the residential home worked hard to ensure that he does not miss out on education and a proper childhood.‚Å£
‚Å£
Help us, to help children like Tim to receive the love that they‚Äôve always yearned for. Gift an Ang Bao this Chinese New Year so we can continue to care for more children alike.‚Å£

7-year-old Nina* and her younger siblings were often left to their own devices since young. Her father was retrenched and her mother suffered from depression. Thankfully, Nina and her siblings were referred to Student Care @ Children‚Äôs Society, where they received after school care in a nurturing environment.‚Å£
‚Å£
After she has graduated from the Centre, she returned as a volunteer to give back to our Society in hopes of impacting the lives of other children, like how our social workers have impacted hers.‚Å£
‚Å£
It warms our hearts to see children such as Nina, who wants to carry on the spirit of love. This motivates us to do even better at our craft. #givingback‚Å£

Tinkle Friend Helpline (1800 2744 788), a national toll-free helpline for primary school children, was first introduced to children who needed a listening ear in November 1984. In 2014, we started providing Tinkle Friend Online Chat service (www.tinklefriend.com) to children as we evolved with technology. Manned by trained staff and volunteers, both services provide support, advice and information to lonely and distressed children especially when their parents or main caregivers are unavailable. 
Beaten by her parents and bullied by her elder brother, nine-year-old Jenny* felt alone and unloved. She turned to the web, and found comfort in Tinkle Friend, who was willing to listen and give her support and advice. Jenny was eventually referred to her school counsellor, and was grateful for the help rendered. 
There may be many more Jennys out there who need our help. Help us today so that we can change someone‚Äôs tomorrow.

3. Get active in a sport!
4. Surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are!
5. Tell someone if you need help!

Our social worker Kate Ofiaza, from Family Service Centre (Yishun) has recently helped a family regain financial independence, after the family encountered difficulties making ends meet. Having approached the Centre for help, Kate rendered emotional support and ad-hoc food rations for Alinah‚Äôs family, equipped Alinah with problem solving and stress management skills, strategised a plan for clearing her debts, motivated her to provide emotional support to her husband, linked Alinah with job fairs and provided school pocket money fund for her daughter.

https://www.instagram.com/p/-u4ur9mUQM/,"Peer influence and peer pressure can be both positive and negative. Some commonly seen negative peer pressure include grouping together to ostracise particular classmates or going after the latest gadgets in order to feel belonged to a group. On the other hand, positive peer pressure can include influencing the child to study together or encouraging the child to help the less fortunate by participating in voluntary work. 
Share with us how you think parents can support their children in dealing with negative peer pressure!

Rewarding your children can reinforce positive behaviours in them and to make them feel good about themselves! One way of rewarding is to do so verbally such as praising them for their good behaviour. For example, give recognition when they assist in clearing the dishes together with you after meal times.

Share with us on the ways you reward your children! üòÑ
