I am very honored to have coauthored a book, a collective memoir, #MyVoice with a few #ladypreneur in #APAC, #Europe and #Africa to share our career journey, our inspirations, and learnings. With everyone‚Äôs, especially our publisher‚Äôs support, the book made it to the ‚ÄúNo. 1 Best Seller‚Äù on #Amazon! üëèüèª

It‚Äôs easy to talk about our wins. It‚Äôs not that easy to talk about our failures, our falls. But that makes a key component of our story, doesn‚Äôt it? I feel that the #challenges, the burnout, the #selfdoubts I went through in last 10 years really changed my perspective to work and life, these experiences further developed my character and shaped who I am today. 

Therefore, in my chapter, ‚ÄúInto the Unknown‚Äù, I shared how I evolved from a #publicrelations, #corporatecommunications person who never thought of standing up for myself to an #executivepresence & #personalbranding #coach, #consultant who mindfully takes baby steps everyday to build a purpose-driven business, aiming at making a direct, positive impact to others‚Äô #career growth.

You can read more about MyVoice and get a copy here: https://lnkd.in/gmcgUfUt
Funds raised from the book sales will go to Singapore Children's Society to help the children in need.

Samuel Rhee, Gregory Van and Jason Huan were and have been so supportive of this project, am very grateful to be a part of Endowus, a company with heart. 

As part of our Endowus Gives Back program, we launched this week our Giving Machines, both physical and virtual for the holiday season. With these machines, people can donate to 15 different charities that we have partnered with, instead of buying an item at a vending machines, they get to give back! It has been a tough couple years for many people. We are working with charities that help children, the elderly, families, and more.

This has been a labour of hard work and love between multiple teams.

Thanks especially to Steffie Vanessia for doing all the very hard work, and to Lean Sing Ding, Reaiah C., Jeffrey Alex Chang, Jennifer Kan, Revin Tan and more over the past few months to bring this to fruition!

We are looking to do more in the coming months and next year with some other really cool ideas and partnerships for people to give back through Endowus. Stay tuned!

The physical machines are at Velocity, United Square and KINEX as of today. They will go live at Marina Square on Nov 13. Please do take pictures with the machines and cards and tag us on social media with the hash tags #EndowusGivesBack #TheGiftofHope.

Get your friends and family down too.For those who can't make it to the malls, or want to share with friends and family and donate more online, you can do so directly at https://lnkd.in/gSthj4Ra, where we have partnered directly with NVPC - Towards a City of Good and giving.sg to get this virtual vending machine running. This virtual vending machine will also be featured on walls across 4 MRT stations come December! Please share the link on all your social media channels!

This moment lit a fire in my heart to come out of the shadows and join the movement against sexual abuse and harassment by sharing my story to increase awareness.  

Since then I have become a dual Amazon international bestselling author by contributing to 2 wonderful initiatives and allowing my shadows to create light.

I M Possible- Stories Of Grit and Perseverance and  #myvoice Volume 2. Stories of Transformation and Purpose by Women of Substance where I share my story about Taking the Boo out of Taboo.  

By having open and courageous conversations about taboo subjects we increase awareness, remove stigma and heal current and future generations.

Thank you Neera Gupta, Shikha Sarkar and Anna Von Zinner and all at Global Influencers Publishing House for your professionalism and support. 

Congratulations to my fellow authors üåü

You will only know how I write and how good my editing is if you buy this book and read all the fabulous, heartfelt chapters. 

You will learn so much about life and people! 

Now to give you the formal blurb that the publishers want you to read...

#MyVoice Vol. 3 ‚Äì Journeys of Self-Discovery and Resilience is an ensemble volume of moving stories detailing the lives of twenty women from varied backgrounds around the world. Every chapter, told in the author's voice, highlights strength, resilience, and a way forward when life seems impossible. These are women to admire and emulate. These are truly stories of self-discovery and resilience. And each one highlights the premise that ""Everyone has a story.""

Funds raised through the sale of this volume will support the work of Singapore Children‚Äôs Society. The Society protects and nurtures children and youth of all races and religions. More details on: www.globalinfluencers.sg

I had spent time, money, and effort on a paranormal romance novel, and had planned to self-publish after agents and publishers had rejected my blurb. Time passed and my novel is still hidden in one of my digital folders.

Years later, I would get this message on WhatsApp 

""Just wanted to check with u if u want to co-author for #MyVoice book and write a chapter?""

I said yes.

This time, I knew what I wanted to write about. Older and, slightly, wiser, I realized what I wanted was to inspire and help others in my own way, cliche though it may be. This is why I'm driven to volunteer.

There was a bit of trepidation when I finished my chapter, because I bared a little more of my self to the world.

Will people judge me after reading my story? Probably

Will it inspire others? I do hope so

Thank you,  Neetha Sanjay for asking me. Thank you,  Neera Gupta of Global Influencers Publishing House for believing in my story.

MyVoice - Volume 4 will come out in March and will feature memoirs from women around world. Proceeds will also go to the Singapore Children's Society 

Stay tuned!
