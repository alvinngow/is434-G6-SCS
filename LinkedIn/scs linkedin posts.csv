At the young age of 2, Shan* was admitted to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society as her parents were unable to care for her due to drug addiction and depression issues. Her mother passed on when she was only 7 years old and Shan stayed on at Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society. 

Shan remained positive and disciplined in her school work, working hard as she aims to be an accountant in the future. She scored good grades in her preliminary examinations and strives to enrol in an accounting course in a local polytechnic. At Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society, we provide a temporary home for children and youth who have been abused or severely neglected to live in. They too, have the right to having their basic needs met just like their age peers. This includes going to school as usual and having pocket money to buy their meals. 

With just $45, you‚Äôll help us to look after one beneficiary, like Shan for one month by paying towards her school pocket money. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Start impacting lives here> bit.ly/sponsorpocketmoney

The seeds for SCC were sown in the late 1970s when then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew expressed concern about ‚Äúlatchkey children‚Äù ‚Äì children who typically wore their house keys around their necks so they could let themselves into their homes after school. These children often returned to empty houses, and fended for themselves until their parents returned from work.

Through the decades, the Student Care service model has evolved with greater emphasis on supporting children from disadvantaged families with school-based student care. This is now available in almost all primary schools. The Ministry of Education is also expanding the After School Engagement programmes for both primary and secondary school students. Within Bukit Merah, many community agencies also provide similar services through their student care centres. This allows us to shift our focus to other needed programmes. We will work with community agencies to explore how we can continue to support the children and young persons living in the area in other ways.

On behalf of all past and present beneficiaries, thank you to the staff and volunteers who have kept the centre going for over four decades, and created fond memories to last a lifetime! ‚ú®

At a young age, Alisah* was separated from her parents due to their incarceration and has been living in Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society since then. Due to the separation, it created some resistance and anxiety in meeting her birth parents when they were first released from prison. Over time, Alisah built up her trust with them, only to be disappointed when her parents got caught for taking drugs again. 

The adversities caused Alisah difficulties in keeping up with her studies and she developed maladaptive ways to cope with her struggles such as hitting her head against the wall. Despite the unfavourable family circumstances and various health concerns, Alisah showed great tenacity and resilience. With the help of care workers at Sunbeam Place @ Children‚Äôs Society, she managed to cope better and developed good moral values. 

Help us to continue providing beneficiaries like Alisah, a safe and nurturing space to develop and grow. A donation of $50 can help cover the transportation costs for a child. Start impacting lives here> https://lnkd.in/geRRR2i

From birth, children would have received much care and attention from their parents. However not all children have the opportunity to grow up in a nurturing environment. John* was only 3 when he witnessed the arrest of his parents due to drug offences.

As a little boy, he would look forward to the release of his parents hoping to have a complete family. However, his dreams were short-lived as his parents continued with their addictions, leading to multiple incarcerations. Because of this, John suffered multiple placement breakdowns, moving from living with his family to his relatives, to a shelter for displaced families and finally to Sunbeam Place @ Children's Society.

Despite these difficult times, John persevered and remained resilient. His interest and talent in floorball kept him grounded as he focused his energy in it and as a result, was able to apply for the school of his choice via Direct School Admission.

With just $90, you can help us to look after one beneficiary, like John for one month by sponsoring his meal costs. This amount might seem small, but it will make a big difference in their lives. Start impacting lives here> bit.ly/sponsormealcosts

If it is food, what is your comfort food? We asked you this question on IG story and some of your responses include waffles & ice cream, porridge and fish head curry! We also asked our Sunbeam Place residents the same question. Besides hanging out with friends, listening to music & getting encouragement or hand written notes from our staff, one favourite comfort food amongst them was bubble tea!

At Children‚Äôs Society, we strive to hear our children‚Äôs voices #intheirownwords through our services and use it to guide the work that we do to bring relief and happiness to children in need.

We offer an array of programmes & services to reach out to children, like the Bully-Free Programme & Tinkle Friend just to name a few.

Every donation you make matters in supporting us while we continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of the children.
