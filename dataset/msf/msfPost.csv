https://www.instagram.com/p/Cad3CjGBvLe/,"#LetsMeet Phillip Tan, recipient of the MSF Outstanding Lifetime Volunteer Award, who has served in the social service sector for 39 years. A champion for community giving, Phillip has helmed @comchestsg since 2013. He believes everyone, including the young, has the capacity to give back and help those in need. One of his many notable contributions was leading the Care and Share @ SG50 Movement which saw 240 social service agencies raise a total of $800 million.

“The most rewarding part about volunteering is the smiles of happiness from the faces of service users and their caregivers and knowing that the little you’ve done has made a difference to people’s lives.

My advice to new volunteers is to enjoy volunteerism, don’t treat it as a chore. Enjoy the companionship and the lifelong friendship with your fellow volunteers and beneficiaries. Don’t worry about the result, just focus on doing good.”

“When I was young, I frequently helped to babysit children. I didn’t just enjoy playing with the babies and toddlers – I loved taking care of them, teaching them, and watching them explore the world. It was the beginning of my interest in child development. 

I applied for MSF’s scholarships and pursued opportunities such as the exchange programme in the United States in my third year of university, and in London for my Master’s programme. These had broadened my understanding on child development and education beyond Singapore.

As a policy officer, I develop and review policies and programmes, where I conduct research and collaborate regularly with stakeholders. MSF is the place for you if you enjoy working with people and are passionate about making a difference.”

At MSF, we develop talent to its fullest potential and provide a meaningful career. Learn more at go.gov.sg/msf-scholarships.

She is an advocate for women’s development in Singapore, having served as the president of the Chinese Women’s association for 26 years. She is also passionate about caring for elderly and managed the Henderson Senior Citizens’ Home for 32 years where she forged best practices in senior care. Over the decades, she has raised funds for countless social causes and charities.
 
Encouraging the next generation of volunteers, Mrs Chen said: “Volunteering should be undertaken with genuine interest, intent and commitment. If one is truly interested in a project, you will find out how to make your efforts work. All problems can be solved somehow, if you work at it with fellow interested persons who enjoy challenges. I’m also pleased that there are more young people starting associations to help others. It is wonderful to see.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ0vBemhncN/,"Family Service Centres (FSC) play a key role in building strong and stable families in Singapore today. They serve individuals and families who need support, to help them cope better with their challenges. However, not many may know that the FSC concept was one of the contributions of pioneer social worker, Thung Syn Neo. 

Starting out as a medical social worker before she became a social work lecturer, Syn Neo eventually took on the role of Director of the Development Division at the then-Ministry of Social Affairs. 

While at the ministry, she led a team of social welfare officers to develop a pilot project for a one-stop community-based centre providing services to support needy families. Partly funded by UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), this pilot project helped to bring social work efforts into the community and marked the start of the FSCs we are now familiar with. There are 48 FSCs located around the island today.

Aside from being a digital advocate in the built environment industry, Nathaniel is also a keen volunteer. He shares about his experience volunteering with his company in ComLink, which helps support families with children living in rental housing.

“It was a wonderful experience seeing the children’s excited and happy faces during a storytelling session I did. Storytelling is a fun way of teaching the children good values and improving their reading. The children and I enjoyed the session so much that I read an additional book to them. 

Working with ComLink families reminded me to give cheerfully. My colleagues also distributed gifts as part of granting the children’s wishes for Christmas at ComLink@Bedok last month. They were happy that they could bring joy to the children.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CYQPTRTs8QR/,"When Dr Kanwaljit Soin was 10 years old, she met a kind doctor in Indonesia who inspired her to become one herself. Years later, she became Singapore’s first female orthopaedic surgeon.

Beyond helping people in the medical field, Kanwaljit is also passionate about advocating for women’s rights. As the first woman in Singapore to become a Nominated Member of Parliament in 1992, she sparked discussions in Parliament on topics such as gender implications in government policies and even proposed the Family Violence Bill. Although it was not passed, key propositions of the bill were later incorporated in reviews of the Women’s Charter. One such proposition was the introduction of Personal Protection Orders for domestic abuse victims.

The former 1992 ‘Singapore’s Woman of the Year’ was also the founding chair of the Singapore chapter of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the founding president of Women’s Initiative for Ageing Successfully (WINGS), and a former president of the Singapore chapter of the International Women’s Forum.

Willing Hearts has a simple philosophy – ""Come See, Judge and Act"".

“We started Willing Hearts in 2005 to make sure that those in need do not have to go hungry. Time is the most important thing that our volunteers can give. We put in the time not just to prepare meals for those in need, but also to engage them, understand their problems, and visit them regularly. Some volunteers arrive as early as 4.30am to help out at our kitchen before they head to work. Their energy keeps us going.”

Willing Hearts is part of the cross-sector Charity Food Workgroup that works on improving the coordination of charity food support. Willing Hearts relies mainly on volunteers to run their daily operations. Find out how you can help: https://willinghearts.org.sg/volunteer-opportunities/✨

“My first Night Missions session took place around Ang Mo Kio central, a place I frequented with my friends. I never noticed the individuals lying on cardboards or hard concrete floors until that night as we walked along those familiar streets. I realised how ignorant I had been.

“It brings me so much joy to befriend the rough sleepers, who often have wise words and advice for me, and the conversations are some of the highlights of my week. It may seem like we are there to help them, but they are also helping us. I have come to realise how support and a listening ear can go a long way to help.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CXxVupFMrqw/,"She was one of the first three women elected to Parliament in 1984. As a sociologist, Dr Aline Wong was familiar with the inequalities women in Singapore faced, and she welcomed the opportunity to address these challenges as a Member of Parliament. 

In her 17-year career in politics, she played an active part in advocating for fairer conditions for women, such as more flexible work arrangements and improved childcare facilities. She launched a sexuality education framework for schools, supported improvements and raised standards for both early childhood education and special needs education. She also led the PAP’s Women’s Wing from its establishment in 1989 till 2001, when she retired from the political scene. 

Aline was later appointed as Singapore’s Representative for Women’s Rights to the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children, and also became the first woman in Singapore’s educational history to be appointed as Chancellor of then-SIM University.

The late Daisy Vaithilingam was inspired to improve the lives of others by her parents, who both worked in the medical field. Her career as a medical social worker only began in 1952, when she joined Singapore General Hospital. At the time, Singapore was beset with problems after the Second World War, such as disease, poverty, and unemployment. Despite these, Daisy was determined to dedicate her life to help those in need. 

Throughout her career, Daisy pioneered many initiatives that significantly impacted Singapore and enabled progress on the social welfare front. These include establishing the first fostering scheme for children, where she assigned hospital attendants to care for children who had been abandoned. She was also passionate about helping children with intellectual disabilities, and would help their parents secure financial aid. In 1962, she led the creation of the current Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) to help children with disabilities integrate into society through education and training programmes.

Daisy also founded the Singapore Association of Social Workers, and started a community project alongside her team of social workers to house underprivileged women in a communal residence. Her passion for social work and compassion towards the less fortunate continues to live on in her enduring legacy. #CelebratingSGWomen",2,22,2021-12-06T04:00:56.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/263707658_422059722944132_1242689339312837703_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=F1iEw5yAY8wAX9fTvq4&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-M5fG7l9qJvim9zZlMPBY_LlW-ldIxJUihP8mQWupsfw&oe=623FDD57&_nc_sid=86f79a,2722465978742132718,2022-03-22T06:07:27.752Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“We created the community shops as an alternative to food pack distribution, to give our beneficiaries the dignity of choice.

Our two community shops in Mountbatten and Boon Lay are run by volunteers. Each beneficiary is given a card with a unique QR code, to redeem 12 food items monthly. From the data collected, we can better understand and cater to our beneficiaries’ needs. It also enables us to be more specific in seeking donations for more popular items like malt drinks or canned sardines.
 
Our surveys found that about 95% of our beneficiaries in Mountbatten prefer to go to our shop instead of receiving food packs. It gives them a reason to leave home to meet neighbours and have a chit chat. We also engage the community around the shops to donate food, which keeps the spirit of neighbours helping neighbours alive.”

In 1967, a time when sex was considered a taboo topic, Dr Nalla Tan championed for sex education to be taught in schools. She led a training course for teachers to educate their students and was also the head of a Singapore Medical Association committee that organised and launched the country’s first public health education programme. Her contribution to the public health education programme is just one of many ways her legacy continues to live on in Singapore. 

Beyond public health education, Dr Tan also advocated for women’s rights in the workplace and spoke about gender-associated prejudices that prevented women from rising up the corporate ladder. She proposed for a central organisation for women, such as a Women’s Affairs department, to be established. Her contributions helped elevate women’s status in employment, education and national development. Dr Tan received the Outstanding Women Award in 1975, and was presented with the Friend of Labour award from the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) in 1984, for her dedication towards the labour movement and advocacy of female employment. #CelebratingSGWomen",1,24,2021-11-23T04:00:57.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/258985980_489029712310684_8740932705215001575_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=onnxCi--0NMAX-uQ4zU&tn=Sdxcu9xVf-bu1dRS&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT82dyxLLlV3Aw3P4TwBVgJ7PhNwDKsf2oqQGWEVsHJbtg&oe=62408473&_nc_sid=86f79a,2713043896009512885,2022-03-22T06:07:27.752Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""When I started offering tuition to children from lower-income families, I realised that many of them were brilliant but lacked confidence in the language. They were unable to understand the lessons in school because these were taught in English. So I worked with fellow educators to develop a special curriculum to help them. 
 
We’re encouraged by parents who in turn became motivated to work with their children in their learning journey. It’s also heartwarming to know that we’re making positive impact, however big or small, in a child's life.
 
It takes a village to support those-in-need within our community. Through ComLink, we’re able to reach children and families who may not know where to get help. We also direct some of our donors to support ComLink’s volunteering efforts.""

A pioneering social worker, a dedicated teacher and mentor, and an activist for victims of domestic violence – these are just some of the ways the late Dr Myrna Braga-Blake is remembered today.

As a young woman, she developed an interest in social work while studying abroad, after being inspired by stories her cousin shared about her work in the sector. Upon her return to Singapore, Myrna pursued a Medical Social Worker diploma at the School of Social Work and worked as a medical social worker in local hospitals like KK Hospital. She later became an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Singapore’s Social Work Department in 1962. 

Although Myrna often travelled and lived overseas due to her husband’s work, her passion for social work remained strong. She pursued further social work education overseas before returning to Singapore to resume her career as a social work lecturer. 

Myrna was president of the Singapore Association of Social Workers (SASW) from 1982 to 1984. During her time with SASW, she helped ensure the quality and effectiveness of social work in Singapore, which is still in practice today. She also became a member of the first Management Committee of PAVE, Singapore’s pioneer family violence specialist centre, and was instrumental in developing services to help victims of domestic violence. 

In 1999, she received the Outstanding Social Worker award with Ms Ang Bee Lian, MSF’s current Director-General of Social Welfare, for her contributions to the community. Together, the ladies pooled their prize money to fund a foundation programme for fresh graduates entering the social work sector – ensuring they would be equipped with the necessary skills as they embarked on their social work journey. #CelebratingSGWomen",0,19,2021-10-22T04:00:43.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/246496990_331879692073043_7986826099071965192_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=oYFI_zaId6YAX-6tmS_&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT9w2BbZR3ocmiVnAKqdBbkScOt-oLqnXSuHixSFNDFHFA&oe=623FEA7A&_nc_sid=86f79a,2689850960010656601,2022-03-22T06:07:27.752Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are thankful for the support from Foster Care Officers whom we can turn to for advice, and a group of foster parents we met through the training sessions to exchange tips and resources with.”

Ann spent four years as a teacher at Methodist Girls’ School, and also taught social work classes on a part-time basis at the National University of Singapore, then known as University of Malaya in Singapore. She later became a training officer with the Social Welfare Department in 1955, where she was in charge of counselling and advice. She made house visits to low-income families in squatter areas and picked up Malay, Cantonese, Hokkien, and other dialects to better communicate and support her clients, many of whom were women that had been abandoned or abused by their husbands. 

In 1957, Ann started teaching full-time at the university, and eventually became head of the Department of Social Studies. She was determined to establish an Honours degree course, so social workers could earn more, like other Honours graduates, and also gain greater access to policy making with their valuable insights and knowledge from working on-the-ground. A four-year honours course was finally introduced in 1985 – just a year before her retirement. 

Thanks to Ann’s dedication and service, social workers in Singapore are able to achieve better career prospects, and be acknowledged as the professionals they are. #CelebratingSGWomen",0,29,2021-09-22T04:00:14.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/242552271_4496725110392197_6494793479046083818_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=yTHVhnxrFfcAX9te0It&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT9IkwPNsly0nP90LtuThzVlVCnIMqqgI1jpBIfwctEu_A&oe=62404111&_nc_sid=86f79a,2668107443563793678,2022-03-22T06:07:27.752Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I remembered how excited and anxious I was when I met my first foster child the first time. The moment she reached out to me for comfort, I knew then that I was doing the right thing.

Fostering children has its own set of challenges and we have to adapt according to each child’s needs. It was all worth it when my foster children wrote me a 'Happy Mother’s Day' card, and I feel so much pride watching them grow and achieve various milestones. We celebrate their small successes to encourage them to strive towards their dreams.

I thought it was important for foster parents in the same neighbourhood to have a support group, so I organised some virtual get-togethers. Some of them are new foster parents, while others have fostering experience. Getting together gives us opportunities to interact, share resources and ‘lobangs’ with one another.”

“It’s important to be open to learning and using technology because it is a part of our daily lives. Having women in tech will help ensure digital tools are designed for them as well,  improving the effectiveness of tech solutions. I started volunteering with women-in-tech organisations because I think such organisations are meaningful. They provide ways for young professionals, girls and women to learn about the tech field, and be introduced to a career path they may not have had access to before, especially since the tech industry is known to be mostly male-dominated.”

When Puan Noor Aishah became the First Lady of Singapore in December 1959, she was just 26-years-old and had little formal education. With no former First Lady to guide her, the wife of Singapore’s first locally-born Head of State Yusof Ishak navigated her role and responsibilities with charm, grace and determination. She managed a large household, organised receptions for visiting dignitaries, involved herself in various organisations and community activities, and even helped to carry out some official and ceremonial duties when her husband’s health started to decline. 

Puan Noor Aishah also introduced a uniquely Singaporean ambience into the Istana, teaching the chefs to whip up homely Asian fare like rendang and epok-epok, instead of English roast beef and pudding.

With her lifelong love for learning, Puan Noor Aishah took English lessons in her later years, which enabled her to make speeches at events. She became patron of organisations such as the Red Cross Society, the Children’s Society, the Association for the Blind, and the Association for the Deaf. As the patron for the Young Women’s Muslim Association (PPIS) and the Singapore Girl Guides Association, she helped  secure land for their headquarters. Her contribution to the Guiding movement in Singapore – both as patron and the Girl Guides’ first Asian president – enabled girls and women in uniform groups to learn useful skills and build a sense of independence through teamwork and leadership activities. 

In 1964, the Government awarded her with the Distinguished Service Medal for her dedication and active involvement in social welfare.

As we celebrate National Day this month, we remember the contributions made by Puan Noor Aishah in the early days of our independence, and her legacy as our nation’s first First Lady.

“Community work is an extension of my passion and beliefs. I was motivated to explore the connection between my role as a doctor and what I can do for the community because of my interests in healthy living. I advocate it and talk to my patients about it regularly. At the same time, I provide health talks and health screenings in different neighbourhoods.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CRNoNrTM-E5/,"#LetsMeet Norasyiqin Binte Habib, a 17-year-old student from ITE College Central, who recently volunteered with the Charity Food Workgroup to conduct a food survey in Kembangan-Chai Chee (KCC). The Workgroup is a cross-sector initiative convened by MSF to strengthen coordination across the charity food landscape in Singapore. KCC is one of three sites where we are piloting the local food coordinator concept.
 
“During our survey, we came across some families who didn’t have the money or were not feeling well enough to buy their own food. We connected them to our KCC local food coordinator, so they could receive food support. I felt happy, knowing that I played a part in helping these families.
 
The volunteering experience was refreshing as I got to interact with many people. My favourite part was when seniors spontaneously shared their stories. These wholesome interactions motivate me to continue volunteering.”
 
If you are thinking of volunteering to help those in need, this is a rewarding experience – just do it!”

“I discovered my love for swimming at the age of 5, when I followed my brothers to swimming classes. I really enjoyed being in the water, as I could jump, do headstands, somersaults, and everything else that others could do on land. The longer I was in the sport, the better I got at it. It was about improving my speed from milliseconds to seconds over time, and believing in myself – knowing that something can happen, and can be done. 

I'm always trying to be a better version of myself, and that's what motivates me even till today. I know that I'm constantly doing my best and I don’t hold on to unrealistic expectations.” — Yip Pin Xiu

https://www.instagram.com/p/CQitmuVB1ii/,"Joseph Oh used to find it daunting to give presentations in school, as he has dysarthria, a motor speech impediment that causes the slurring of words. That changed after he was introduced to assistive technology in 2018.

“During my first year at @republicpoly, my Special Education Needs counsellor connected me with @spdsingapore, who recommended a few assistive technology devices for me to try. I chose Proloquo4Text, an Augmentative and Alternative Communication system that allowed me to customise the text, accent and tone according to my needs. It was useful for my daily presentations, which required me to use various scientific words and technical terms. I was able to better express my thoughts, and my lecturers could also assess my academic performance more accurately.”

Joseph, who graduated with a Diploma in Marine Science and Aquaculture, is now a Laboratory Technologist at Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory.
 
The Third Enabling Masterplan aims to empower persons with disabilities like Joseph, to achieve their potential and integrate fully as contributing members of society. Read more here: go.gov.sg/emp-microsite

https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhexYPHF3S/,"For @alister_ong who was born with cerebral palsy, accessibility is not just about getting around physically.

“Accessibility in school allowed me to receive an education and collaborate with my peers. After graduation, access to public transport connected me with the workforce, where I could gain financial independence.

One way to help persons with disabilities is to approach us and ask if we need any help. Asking is important because everyone has different preferences. This would help you understand us better, and learn how to interact with, offer help and accommodate us. This would pave the way for us to become a more inclusive nation.”

Read more about the recommendations to improve accessibility in the built environment and transportation. These recommendations, that will help Alister and others with physical disabilities move around more on their own independently, were made by the Third Enabling Masterplan (EMP 3) Workgroup on Independent Living: go.gov.sg/emp-microsite.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CPQGbN-rMNR/,"Celebrating SG Women | She Who Left A Legacy

In the 1950s, women in Singapore were falling behind men in areas such as education and employment. Polygamy was accepted and many women lived in difficult circumstances. For the late Chan Choy Siong, a pioneering politician and campaigner for women’s rights, this was unacceptable. Despite being derided for her humble background as a hawker’s daughter, she was determined to achieve equality for women.

After being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, Choy Siong joined activists from the Singapore Council of Women in their call to better protect and speed up the emancipation of women. She campaigned for the drafting and passing of the Women’s Charter to put husband and wife on an equal footing before the law.

The Women’s Charter was enacted in 1961 to protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. Over the years, legislation has been reviewed to ensure the Charter stays relevant as society evolves. 

Today is the 60th anniversary of the Women’s Charter. In the Year of Celebrating SG Women, we celebrate the women, and men, who have championed initiatives for women’s development over the years. They have worked hard to set the foundation for our progress today.

https://www.instagram.com/p/COKyuJEsqnk/,"After joining a gang when he was in secondary school, Jasper soon got into fights, and got hooked on smoking and drugs. When he was later sent to the Singapore Boys' Home (SBH) after getting caught for vehicle theft and robbery, he felt that his life ""was put on pause"".
 
""My friends and family would write letters to me and what struck me was that the whole world continued to spin with or without me. My friends were taking their N Levels and I was stuck in Secondary 2. I started to take my studies seriously,"" said Jasper.
 
Today, the 27-year-old is an entrepreneur who founded @eezee.sg, a B2B online marketplace, with his friends. He believes this journey would not have been possible without his mentors, who provided timely and necessary guidance along the way to steer him back on the right path. Jasper has even returned to the SBH to share his life story, and volunteered with MSF’s Youth GO! Programme to reach out to at-risk youths on the streets.
 
Jasper is also part of MSF’s Youth Advisory Group, a diverse group of youths who provide their perspectives to the National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism, which oversees efforts to prevent offending, re-offending and enhance rehabilitation of offenders.
 
To help youths like Jasper realise their true potential, MSF will continue to partner our community to better support them. We will also be piloting a mentoring programme targeted at students who leave ITE prematurely. Find out more at www.go.gov.sg/MSFCOS2021.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CNrOK5tH1od/,"Madam Linda and her son are among the beneficiaries of ComLink, which was launched in 2019 at four locations to better support families with children living in rental housing.
 
“There are many programmes being offered at ComLink. My son, who is in Primary 3, needs guidance in his studies and receives tuition there. It has been a smooth and happy experience for my son. He loves the fun and enjoys interacting with his teachers and friends. It is convenient as the programme is located just next to my block so I do not need to worry about travelling,” said Madam Linda.
 
Thanks to the partnership between government agencies, companies and community partners, Madam Linda's son participates in @kids.excel Singapore (an inclusive Sports and Academic development programme), a tuition programme with social enterprise @kindlespark.sg, a reading programme with @sg.bless (Bringing Love to Every Single Soul) and @moneywhizz_sg (a financial literacy workshop for young children run by NUS students).
 
To help her with her health needs, Madam Linda also receives free essential medical treatment through @satacommhealth’s Doctors-On-Wheels service.
 
Over the next two years, ComLink will be expanded nation-wide to 21 towns, benefitting 14,000 families. ComLink provides proactive outreach to these families, close case support depending on families’ needs and customised programmes and services through galvanizing the community. If you are interested to volunteer with us and make a difference in the lives of these families, sign up at www.volunteer.sg.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CNJj6uiJ3MC/,"Under the KidSTART Home Visitation Programme, Rachel Lua has become more confident with her parenting skills, as she learnt different ways to educate, bond and communicate with her two-year old son.
 
“Before joining KidSTART, I was often unsure of my parenting ability, and felt overwhelmed while taking care of my son. Our KidSTART Home Visitor, Ms Hannah Dass, taught me many different parenting strategies, such as paying attention to the tone of my voice when I am angry with my son or trying to explain things to him, so as to make him listen to me and not be hurt by my words. Ms Hannah also checked in regularly on my mental well-being, assuring me that it was okay to take breaks and enjoy some “me” time.
 
I am really thankful for Ms Hannah’s support and encouragement, which have helped me develop a better relationship with my son, and learn the importance of practicing self-care. My son also looks forward to seeing his favourite Auntie Hannah,” said Rachel.
 
The KidSTART Home Visitation Programme is a key component of KidSTART, which provides upstream support to pregnant mothers and young children up to 6 years old from low-income families. This year, KidSTART will be expanded further to Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang to benefit more families. A dedicated KidSTART Singapore office has also been set up to support the scale-up.

“As a student, I was often jeered at for my poor academic performance, which affected my self-esteem. I was fortunate to have received support and guidance from my parents and teachers, who believed in my potential and gave me opportunities to develop my strengths. This made me realise the importance of having a strong support system in life. Hence, I want to provide the same support to other youths who are going through challenging times.

In my role at Youth Infinity now, I work primarily with youth drug offenders and strive to help them find their voice and self-identity. Once, a client told me that he trusted no one apart from his mother due to the hurt, betrayal and anger that he had experienced from the people around him. As a result, he chose to isolate himself. I continued to engage him and he gradually opened up to me. He also slowly developed the confidence to rebuild his trust in others. When I see youths like him move on and grow into a better version of themselves, I am reminded that the work I do is impactful.”

“I went into family law quite early in my career, with a focus on women, as I found this area interesting. When I formed the Singapore Association of Women Lawyers in 1974, I wanted to help women in blue-collar jobs, who were often subjected to workplace harassment, to learn more about the law. I introduced free legal counselling for them by setting up counselling centres.
 
One of my most defining moments was securing a new headquarters for the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations, which I was a founder member of. As we wanted a space of our own to host visitors from other women’s organisations, I remember going on an arduous hunt for locations and engaging in relentless negotiations, before we landed on 96 Waterloo Street – a place we could finally call home.
 
Over the years, being able to contribute to the developments of the legal profession relating to women and the family has been a memorable experience for me. It is important for our women to have a say in society, as it will continue to impact our lives. I set out to implement change for the next generation of women in Singapore, and today, I’m proud of far our women have progressed. Equality is not impossible.
 
I could only embark on this journey because I was able to stand on the shoulders of my predecessors. I really want to say ‘thank you’ to all my friends, family, and supporters, who have stood by me throughout.” – Anamah Tan, 81

""During the final year of my fashion diploma course, a doctor asked me to design clothes for his bedridden patients who faced challenges getting dressed. This was when I realised there was a need in this area that I could address with my skills.

To design these apparels, we&nbsp;first have to&nbsp;understand our clients’&nbsp;needs through observation and conducting interviews with them. We then ideate and test&nbsp;the practicality of the designs&nbsp;before&nbsp;going into&nbsp;production.&nbsp;Once, there was an 6-year-old girl with a stump on one arm who&nbsp;needed alterations to her school&nbsp;apron,&nbsp;as it was difficult for her to tie it around her back. We&nbsp;helped her to get around this with our SwipeFit function, which allowed her to fasten the apron easily through Velcro tapes.&nbsp;

It heartens me to hear that the&nbsp;clothes we make&nbsp;has made&nbsp;life easier for&nbsp;our clients, and empowered them to be more&nbsp;independent.&nbsp;I am excited to impact more lives through&nbsp;Will and Well!”",2,97,2020-12-24T04:00:17.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/130995091_309068320419904_1363436710756166671_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=YXL8LLu1TgAAX_GuV6Q&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT8OwZ-onca_wQgt0_B_dGUGna2S7y1up4HPjwpGwoG7fg&oe=6241285A&_nc_sid=86f79a,2470968466492950132,2022-03-22T06:07:30.068Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,raiSE Singapore,raisesg,,,,,,,,,,

“The idea of starting a business to promote inclusivity first struck me when I was a final-year university student. I learnt about social stigmas surrounding those with special needs, and wanted to dispel them by promoting interactions between the general public and special needs community.

Today, at Foreword Coffee Roasters, each cup of coffee is made and served by individuals with special needs and disabilities, which gives them the opportunity to engage with customers. We also provide them with on-the-job training to equip them with skills for career progression.

“As someone who advocates sustainable behaviours, I was attracted to join DBS’ Zero Food Waste Taskforce, which paved the way for our partnership with The Food Bank Singapore. We believe that no one should go hungry, and wanted to do something to help vulnerable individuals and families who struggle with basic food needs.

Over the past year, we have been working on an app that allows food support organisations to submit requests from their beneficiaries directly to food donors, ensuring that beneficiaries receive the right amount and types of food that they need. I’m looking forward to the app's launch later this year, as I hope it will help to reduce one of Singapore's largest waste streams, food waste. If we can be mindful of the food that we buy and consume, I am hopeful for a more food secure world in the future.”",0,39,2020-11-02T04:00:49.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/123216629_394081305056214_2228375623100509316_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=yF3AKYf4EMwAX-QGXzj&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-AKlqFWflpG6fGeQmre3DWBp-T1NwOMyvresR4FFwjLA&oe=623F6E81&_nc_sid=86f79a,2433280400789914614,2022-03-22T06:07:30.068Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“5 years ago, my struggle with depression and an eating disorder led me to drop out of university. It was a really tough decision to make, as I was already in my third year then.

I decided to visit an art therapist who helped me work through my issues, and taught me to express my emotions through art. As someone who has gravitated towards the visual arts since a young age, the practice of art-making naturally went beyond the therapy room for me. I set up an Instagram account @he.artnotes to share my artworks, and spread hope and positivity to others, which helped me cope better with my mental health conditions, and get my life back on track.

Now, I am also reaching out to youths from rental households through BLESS' upcoming mental health workshops.

I hope that my story can inspire people to take charge of their mental health, and seek help early.”",0,85,2020-10-10T02:00:07.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/121021235_362000045220415_4489424562798505261_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=nzaHOn6MaAkAX-cBeWR&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT9CrRI5YGeRadMqLeeGWGvYMobjQQyEODpgaZqb7YWpeQ&oe=62402450&_nc_sid=86f79a,2416549804453781448,2022-03-22T06:07:30.068Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although she felt trapped in her marriage, Diana thought that bearing the abuse was her duty as a wife. Family members that she confided in didn’t believe her either.

One day, Diana decided to seek help as she feared for her children’s safety and emotional well-being. With her son’s support, Diana plucked up her courage and sought help from social service organisations. She then filed for a Personal Protection Order to protect herself and her children. 

Diana encourages other victims of family violence to speak up: “Don’t worry about looking weak. Seeking help is necessary to rebuild yourself.” Today is the #InternationalDayofNonViolence. If you or someone you know is experiencing abuse, reach out to a Family Violence Specialist Centre and break the silence.",0,33,2020-10-02T04:31:00.000Z,,,Video,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/120371478_1536199803230226_170330351633336577_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=ksm5m7UOiYQAX8dq1nY&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-tK4cyr8iAnf2dEr7hLx2nR0eu1NJn4PPBrzTAJd5iYQ&oe=623BBE6F&_nc_sid=86f79a,2410827508032609745,2022-03-22T06:07:30.068Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/120751426_330960007966028_7007556411400763569_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjk2MC5mZWVkLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=ph1ExoSeaXIAX8pI31-&edm=APU89FABAAAA&vs=17873603896940587_2702138360&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdFS0ZNZ2RNcmJXaEFTMEJBTEc0RGJWdDF6OWhia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHRHQyTUFlX25VMW5IOFFDQUZ1blNTMnhMMTQxYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMBUAACbWnOaP1vy%2FPxUCKAJDMywXQBwAAAAAAAAYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdeoHAA%3D%3D&ccb=7-4&oe=623B8EF2&oh=00_AT-1aD2VAj7VINWa11K2Jb8znv4qN4Qh5lZLKjQC-0nXnA&_nc_sid=86f79a,862,,,,,,,,,,,,

“I first learnt sign language in secondary school through interacting with my fellow hard-of-hearing friends, and joining activities that included the deaf. Although I faced difficulties understanding the vocabulary of sign language initially, I eventually mastered the language when I started working with the deaf community two years ago.
 
As a counsellor now, sign language helps me to communicate clearly with my deaf clients, and understand their needs to provide suitable help, which can range from financial assistance to marriage counselling.
 
Although sign language is not the only form of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, it allows me to express myself better, compared to gesturing or writing. More importantly, it has brought me closer to the deaf community.”",1,107,2020-09-23T04:54:17.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/119987404_346172419839467_203145456941843536_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=0a_IevRwajUAX-Y9WfF&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_4dBouLE6U4gECV2MkapaCIiAK8dMruzU9JGwAKZfzpQ&oe=62402F7B&_nc_sid=86f79a,2404316283590382460,2022-03-22T06:07:30.068Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By scheduling family mealtimes, it makes us feel loved, as we know that we will always set aside time for each other. To make sure that we spend quality time together, everyone eats at the same table, and we won’t switch on the television or other electronic devices. Even books are kept on the table. 

Tonight, Papa is going to make the children's favourite pasta and Mama is preparing their favourite drink - bandung! It may sound like a strange combo, but there’s no place like home, where we can be a little silly and it is always OK.” - @estherlaoshi @elvinfoong

I recall an incident when a young caller felt so lonely that it triggered a panic attack. During that call, I was able to ease her anxiety and calm her down. It was good that she decided to seek help, and the incident inspired me to carry on helping those in need during these unprecedented times.”

""I believe that innovation is key in the social service space, and this is what keeps me motivated to constantly try new ways of doing things at Glyph.
 
Despite not being able to conduct our usual activities with the kids during the Circuit Breaker period, we took the initiative to check in on their families' well-being through regular calls and messages. To ensure that their basic needs were taken care of, we personally delivered meals to them, and even found creative ways of engaging the kids through online gaming parties! As part of MSF's Community Link initiative, we were also able to reach out to rental families in Jalan Kukoh and Marsiling.

“My artwork was inspired by my personal experience of living in an HDB flat with neighbours of different races. I think that the Ethnic Integration Policy makes Singapore stand out from other countries, and plays a vital role in shaping a multi-racial nation.

To me, the COVID-19 crisis reinforces the importance of compassion and mutual understanding. In the midst of challenges, there is always good to be found if we stand as one. Only by working together can Singapore become a better place where we can prosper.”

When Sheila was found misbehaving both at home and in school, her maternal step grandmother gave her an ultimatum: live with her mother, or be sent to the Singapore Girls’ Home.
 
Sheila eventually returned to her mother’s care, but unfortunately had difficulty bonding with her family. She ran away from home, mixed with bad company, experimented with inhalants and engaged in underage sex.
 
Helpless, her mother decided to apply for a Family Guidance Order (FGO) under the Children and Young Persons Act, which can be issued by Youth Court to a child or youth below 16 years who needs additional guidance.
 
Before Sheila’s mother can apply to Youth Court for an FGO, the family must complete a pre-FGO programme, which aims to reduce conflict and improve parent-child communication.",0,87,2020-08-05T04:00:30.000Z,,,Video,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/116707876_328884898266600_6526760904624781828_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=6QO81TD5w4UAX-wFe0K&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT9XOwLj7lLTtiqP5lf8BOGBTi7ubxzoXaP2pVP1i-0Uxw&oe=623BC36B&_nc_sid=86f79a,2368775184797648941,2022-03-22T06:07:30.070Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/117182919_294124231876788_769758289876251459_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5mZWVkLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=YzKocwhruFoAX9Of1jS&edm=APU89FABAAAA&vs=17855353622141694_2395785385&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdNY1ItQWEwWUZ3aWdRc0JBRU56LUJZV3U2NEtia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHTVNiX2dhWElsNG96eVVKQU56TWlVR1MwQVFzYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMBUAACb8wqiAr9a3PxUCKAJDMywXQBwAAAAAAAAYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdeoHAA%3D%3D&ccb=7-4&oe=623B85B1&oh=00_AT-3z98Aoh1VkqOF0jyil5zfCNjvPIUlgD9EvsHYWngFoA&_nc_sid=86f79a,1549,,,,,,,,,,,,

When she turned 13, her mother passed away and she had to live alone with her abusive father, who even disallowed her to mourn for her deceased mother.
 
Traumatised, Kelly had difficulties managing her emotions and started to self-harm. One day, she overdosed on depressants and was admitted into a psychiatric hospital.
 
For her safety and well-being, Kelly was referred to MSF’s Child Protective Service (CPS) and has been living in a Voluntary Children’s Home since she was 14.
 
Now 16, Kelly faces self-esteem issues but uses the skills she learnt in therapy to cope with her feelings and thoughts. Kelly’s father, however, has not visited her in 2 years, and refuses to work with CPS on reunification with her.
 
For youths like Kelly, the amendments to the Children and Young Persons Act are helpful. The newly-introduced Enhanced Care and Protection Order can allow her to continue living safely with a designated caregiver until she is independent, giving her more time to recover.",2,149,2020-07-29T04:00:50.000Z,,,Video,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/116608477_314009289744865_86525340352978220_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=tMOjDLaoMboAX_RYz38&tn=Sdxcu9xVf-bu1dRS&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_snDHMJh_-zKmPCAq5MITchS3EDgsADSo_SC1xBA1Xfg&oe=623B9352&_nc_sid=86f79a,2363701889877306665,2022-03-22T06:07:30.070Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/116799412_3029273580516037_6000685962459709914_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjk2MC5mZWVkLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=bYrZT1YT0xQAX8xjvDG&tn=Sdxcu9xVf-bu1dRS&edm=APU89FABAAAA&vs=17875680676757579_222796814&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdMUTM5Z2JGc3JHM0c4TUtBTnFCRlFFWHVFWlRia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHSEpsN0FZZzU2RFhXMW9CQURDdFhlRmdPbmNKYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMBUAACaWva%2Brx%2FXAPxUCKAJDMywXQBgAAAAAAAAYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdeoHAA%3D%3D&ccb=7-4&oe=623BE93F&oh=00_AT_ZUqvapcrKvOnYIUfMMo_eKUd7_cKRPoOmbKDYNgZabg&_nc_sid=86f79a,1961,,,,,,,,,,,,

I assisted the core team in CPS with their active intervention cases. Weekly, I engaged in video calls with vulnerable families and observed the identified children for unusual behaviour.

I have learnt to be impartial when it comes to working alongside these families because very often, the perpetrators also need our helping hand.

“When I was let go by my company earlier this year after COVID-19 affected the business, I was worried about not being able to pay my bills.
.
However, I'm really thankful for the financial support. While I took up temporary work as a social distancing ambassador to support myself, the grants from TRF and CSG helped me settle immediate payments and even enabled me to pursue a part-time Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications course in psychology and criminology.

However, I'm really thankful for the financial support. While I took up temporary work as a social distancing ambassador to support myself, the grants from TRF and CSG helped me settle immediate payments and even enabled me to pursue a part-time Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications course in psychology and criminology.

“We work with young adults from many walks of life, and one of the groups with enormous potential are probationers referred through MSF. Building trust and rapport with them has been a consistent challenge, as many have been scarred from past instances where others have betrayed their trust. To get around this, we invest a lot of time and energy to connect with them, and understand their interests to match them to suitable companies.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CAMcJu_nPNM/,"Mary (not her real name) was only 3 months old when she was placed in a foster family. Despite growing up with more brothers and sisters than she could count, Mary never felt any less loved, as her foster parents had showered them all with undivided love and attention.

She recalls her foster mother crying whenever it was time for her foster siblings to return to their natural families, but her tears soon turned into joy when a new foster child showed up in their home just a few weeks later.

Fast-forward to almost 35 years later, Mary is now a successful individual in the finance industry and continues to keep in touch with her foster family.

She hopes that more families will step forward to offer their homes to vulnerable children. “I wish that all children can have a chance to grow up in a safe and loving home. If you can, why not be the one to make a difference to their lives?” 🌟",1,41,2020-05-15T04:02:56.000Z,,,Video,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/97958890_250426432702788_3143352490631577431_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=j122AOAmKrMAX_DQQVy&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT8zl4Vbbf9usMQueeFfWiv5GkK4yKKYU0gMyYqWfVbfzQ&oe=623BF6A0&_nc_sid=86f79a,2309344523171197772,2022-03-22T06:07:30.070Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/96596309_1407116619471843_6664037991406231391_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5mZWVkLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=1cbY8WZM-i8AX8WJ31f&edm=APU89FABAAAA&vs=18099005374146943_1542349242&_nc_vs=HBkcFQAYJEdGWHh3UVhqMjBMZXctOEVBRi1mZWQ4X2EzdGNia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBACgAGAAbAYgHdXNlX29pbAEwFQAAJv6D1JDivKZAFQIoAkMzLBdALHdLxqfvnhgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB16gcA&ccb=7-4&oe=623BF894&oh=00_AT8053JCCszWliitYkR93u-d4idUQ1kXkPp1GLCfAFXwwQ&_nc_sid=86f79a,743,,,,,Singapore,105565836144069,,,,,,

.
“Mothers love their children wholeheartedly and can sacrifice a lot for their children. The mothers that I have met in our clinics demonstrate amazing strength in caring for their children, and are determined to help them overcome challenges by pursuing different therapies.
.
I have experienced a mother’s sacrifice too. My mum visited me while I was training in the US recently. When COVID-19 hit the state that we were in, I asked my mum to return to Singapore first, for her own safety, but she insisted to stay behind together with me. This showed me that my mum is someone I know I can always rely on.
.
This Mother’s Day, I would like to tell my mum how much I love her and appreciate everything that she has done for me.

Here’s wishing all mothers a wonderful Mother’s Day! 💖💐”",0,42,2020-05-10T02:30:14.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/96679240_712911596145404_5449700225247103250_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=rfzekFe1L-sAX9MsN8z&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT88LScBWeAS_5bbhcGcoSzxhBnrhtVasofqN4_OvWY5Rg&oe=6240CAEC&_nc_sid=86f79a,2305674276157363388,2022-03-22T06:07:33.242Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,Singapore,105565836144069,,,,,,

.
While on probation, Serene discovered that she was pregnant and went for an abortion, which was the toughest decision she had to make.
.
Thankfully, her Probation Officer, Ms Andrea, was a great source of support that helped to keep her going by teaching her ways to overcome challenges and giving her a space to express herself freely.
.
Today, Serene is determined to make good of the lessons learnt during her probation and become a better person.💪🏻

With the love and support from her foster family, Jane gradually began to trust them.
.
An avid dancer, Jane was touched when she received a pair of sneakers from her foster parents, as it symbolised their support for one of her greatest passions.
.
Today, she cherishes every moment she has with her foster family, and hopes that more families will step forward to offer their homes to youths like herself.

“Inclusivity begins in the preschool classroom, where young minds are nurtured to accept others who may be different.
.
It’s important to provide integrated support from the preschool, therapists and Early Intervention educators to children with developmental needs. At the end of the day, these children and their families will need to feel welcomed and, most importantly, accepted by the community.” #InclusiveSG",0,24,2020-04-21T08:27:42.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/93755122_222239222430572_749698229682911451_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=oF5FZPch4TUAX9OMSTM&tn=Sdxcu9xVf-bu1dRS&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT84i-gtaDKpDEBOIOkXubJ_vOUUUTPyaXHNoPKJTUhkyQ&oe=6240BDCB&_nc_sid=86f79a,2292083460851630912,2022-03-22T06:07:33.242Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,Singapore,105565836144069,,,,,,

.
“I chose to be a Child Protection Officer because I've always wanted to work with vulnerable children and families. Common misperceptions others have about these families are that they are disempowered and victims of their circumstances. Nothing can be further from the truth. The families I work with have taught me the power of hope and resilience, and what it means to never give up. In getting to know them, I seek out their strengths to help them achieve their potential.
.
Social Work can get challenging but social workers never walk alone. The children and families are supported by people like myself and professionals in the community who journey alongside them. When tough days come, I look at the children to remind myself why I joined the Child Protective Service in the first place.”",3,165,2020-03-17T09:57:36.000Z,,,Video,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/90085992_350115525875790_3110073846327287199_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=-kfUrX0yEZoAX9i_5eh&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_zDz_95USeH2L5IzWeoPYWwOFsdXU4CRdZbuDs1znjDw&oe=623BE411&_nc_sid=86f79a,2266761108396019503,2022-03-22T06:07:33.242Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/89736860_246175143087826_4362956498916979705_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjU3Ni5mZWVkLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=l-kaMnApQTQAX89fSIE&edm=APU89FABAAAA&vs=17857954702798325_3611292886&_nc_vs=HBkcFQAYJEdKeEdXUVhTenZRZDVkOEFBUG16YmVEUlZZdzhia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBACgAGAAbAYgHdXNlX29pbAEwFQAAJurf29Di7bg%2FFQIoAkMzLBdAFEOVgQYk3RgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB16gcA&ccb=7-4&oe=623B986E&oh=00_AT_I_VyGM36Qwl24Nie5_qVrGYJdZ3QePoFEZ2Cmz5fycA&_nc_sid=86f79a,2010,,,,,Singapore,105565836144069,,,,,,

It is especially rewarding for me to help distressed caregivers find relief, or mend family ties that were once strained as I grow closer to my clients and their families.

In 2 days, warm-hearted Singaporeans from all walks of life contributed more than $2 million to the Courage Fund, with more coming in. The Courage Fund was set up 17 years ago during SARS. It will be used by Community Chest during COVID-19 to support patients, healthcare workers and vulnerable Singaporeans who are impacted by the disease. 
Thank you to everyone who has contributed, including Capitaland Hope Foundation, President’s Challenge, Far East Organization, Keppel, Great Eastern Singapore and many individuals and corporations. With your outpouring of generosity, we will better be able to support the most vulnerable among us.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B38PvpOHvYO/,"Winner of the Outstanding Early Childhood Teacher Award, Amanda Yap from @littleskoolhousesg, believes in engaging her preschoolers through intentional play, where learning takes place all the time.

For her, ‘The Three Little Pigs‘ is not a mere fable but a fun way to teach the children hypothesis testing, problem solving skills, and even material properties!

The greatest joys of teaching for Amanda are the improvements she sees her children make, and one of her proudest moments was when ‘a very introverted child’ took the first step of initiating a conversation with her peers, even if it was just a simple ‘hello’. #earlychildhoodeducation #teachersofinstagram #teacher #preschool #learnthroughplay #children #kids",1,29,2019-10-23T00:58:48.000Z,,,Video,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/74790195_138225194153105_6776868650445676411_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=zGDJ-pWJm2oAX_ztVTO&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT8_hgUuJIVLRQt1W8reM1wOfs1NtJ_caSnwvC7gOaWmlg&oe=623B822D&_nc_sid=86f79a,2160671166004393486,2022-03-22T06:07:35.985Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/73118964_443310299627873_1684139429661292040_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5mZWVkLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=_4OtpeE7OZ4AX_2QEJ5&edm=APU89FABAAAA&vs=17851113247643631_4190355663&_nc_vs=HBkcFQAYJEdQUzBXd1JoUWU4NE1KTUJBQWkyTUdualExOFhia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBACgAGAAbAYgHdXNlX29pbAEwFQAAJt6ArNrF37U%2FFQIoAkMzLBdAGCHKwIMSbxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB16gcA&ccb=7-4&oe=623BC20C&oh=00_AT8mKKyU_CJscOuvIoyj-vN9zT5pem97W3l9LqRxtrLHlQ&_nc_sid=86f79a,378,,,,,Singapore,105565836144069,,,,,,

After an assessment by one of MINDS’ Senior Training Officers, his passion for crafts was discovered. Now, Kok Wai creates paintings for MINDS Craft, one of MINDS Social Enterprise’s eight product lines. Kok Wai’s painting technique of choice? A unique mix of brush strokes and finger dabbing to create intricate textures on his art pieces!

Working at MINDS Craft has not only helped Kok Wai discover his calling for the Arts, it has also allowed him to improve his socialisation skills. Now, he interacts with people confidently and does not hesitate to help when his friends are in need.

“Many of the families in the Jalan Kukoh community that we support have multi-faceted needs, ranging from financial to more complex family needs. And while there are resources within the community, it is not always easy for families to know where these services are, and how to get to them.
Community Link is an opportunity for us, as community partners, to work together more purposefully, and be more proactive in reaching out to residents. It is also a chance for us to create programmes that are more community-based, with residents and volunteers involved.
As for the residents, my hope is that Community Link will be a space that they can walk into with ease, to be linked up with the services they need, and be engaged in the different programmes available. By working together hand in hand with a common vision, we can uplift families.” – Annie Chia, 42, Principal Social Worker, Montfort Care – Kreta Ayer Family Services
This year, MSF will be working with community partners like Kreta Ayer Family Services to launch Community Link in four estates to better support families living in rental flats.",1,52,2019-03-13T10:14:07.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/52527562_1905073879621879_7005029076389076595_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=eiCvnG_py3EAX9g8Km-&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT9lSUWjlvxTq5zps9soVEaTIiQ8Rp40RjlhEWKjol-XNQ&oe=62411076&_nc_sid=86f79a,1998602853333411771,2022-03-22T06:07:38.552Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“My children are my everything. As a mother, I recognise that the early years are important in my children’s development, so I made the conscious decision to put a hold on my career to care full time for them. I hope to return to work when my younger child is older and I can put her in childcare.
I do what I can to give my children the best, but sometimes, this adds to our expenses. These everyday expenses can put pressure on my husband as the sole breadwinner of our family.
So it gives me a greater peace of mind that I qualify for more child care subsidy support from the Government, and for a longer period of time too! This eases my worry on subsidies for my older one in child care, and helps me focus on nurturing my younger one at home.” – Lee Siok Hong, 38, mother of two, with her baby daughter Mavis.
Siok Hong’s family is one of around 5,000 households who are expected to benefit from enhanced child care subsidy support from the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) from 1 March this year.",0,29,2019-03-12T09:26:05.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/52661926_345894669359081_1266798032225652074_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=rGfyhV0WmfMAX-Z16xl&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT8lDtH4dq-Z1nYKv4oSHL_MMfyCrWpVfh04DeQNmgw1JA&oe=6240E7FC&_nc_sid=86f79a,1997853894335818498,2022-03-22T06:07:38.552Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With my condition, finances can be tight, but I get help from the Government for my medical and daily living expenses. This means less worry for my family. If I have problems, I can always talk to the staff from Fei Yue Senior Activity Centre, or Priya from the Social Service Office.
I am also close to my family. We are a big family - I have sisters, one brother, nieces and nephews. They are like my friends, because they always like to joke around and ‘disturb me’!
But seriously, I cannot imagine my life without my family. Especially my sister who stays with me, and makes sure I am okay. She looks strict, but I know deep down inside she cares.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/Buu3C9TBZyf/,"#FACESOFMSFCARES “Music keeps me going. It reinvigorates me and reminds me of all the young people whose lives I have influenced, and those whom I have yet to mentor.

When I was young, I wasn’t very good at expressing my thoughts and feelings, and didn’t have many friends. My only outlet then was playing the guitar and that gave me a voice to express myself. My experiences have helped me empathise with others who have similar challenges. As an Assistant Lead of the Therapeutic Group Home at Boys Town, I’ve had the privilege of overseeing youths who have gone through acute or complex trauma. My main objective is to help these youths integrate into society, and have a second shot in life. Everyone deserves a chance, and I thought, if I have the ability to bring that chance to them, why not? My work at Boys’ Town has been rewarding, especially when we see our youths improving and progressing well. Results certainly do not come easy, so a little patience and a whole lot of passion go a long way! Whenever I encounter a case that is particularly trying, I remind myself why I signed up in the first place. I pause for a minute, play a few tunes and push on again.
I’m glad that we can also see what lies ahead for us as social service professionals. The Skills Framework for Social Service has helped shed light on progression paths that one can take in this sector. I can also clearly explain to my team the different job roles, tasks and relevant skills they need to equip themselves with, to plan for their career development.”– Muhammad Farhan Bin Kamsani, 29, Assistant Lead of the Therapeutic Group Home at Boys’ Town. Farhan supervises a team of officers in providing therapeutic care to youths aged 12- to 16-years-old who have experienced acute or complex trauma. The Skills Framework for Social Service helps professionals like Farhan to map out career progression pathways, and guides organisations in developing talent. MSF will also be setting up a new Social Service SkillsFuture Tripartite Taskforce, comprising sector professionals, academics and policymakers, to build on these efforts and drive skills development initiatives in the social service sector.",0,21,2019-03-08T03:26:26.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/50074712_332787887352471_653092477575337743_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=06bB44YH2CAAX8uj7xM&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_BqvGm5EyKJbo8iqRxSYTd1oRfKopzj7A-zkErNQ_0iw&oe=62403470&_nc_sid=86f79a,1994773780786158751,2022-03-22T06:07:38.552Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.instagram.com/p/BusOKO9BvZy/,"#FACESOFMSFCARES - EXTENSION OF POST-CARE SUPPORT “I was very rebellious when I was young. I didn’t like my parents as I found it hard to communicate with them. I spent more time with my friends, and got influenced by them. I always wanted to prove myself, but in the wrong way, like through fighting.

After everything happened, I realised it was not worth it. I got in and out of the Singapore Boys’ Home several times for remand and detention. My father kept visiting me when I was in remand until he almost lost his job. I remember when the Police came to arrest me, my mother pleaded to the Police not to handcuff me. The last time I went to the Singapore Boys’ Home, I had already given up on myself.

But my parents did not give up on me. I was touched and decided then that I must change and not make my parents sad.

I made good use of my time in the Home. I continued with my studies and picked up new skills, like specialty coffee making. I also did an internship with Bettr Barista. The teachers, Youth Guidance Officers, and my case worker were supportive, and always took the time to find out how I was doing.

I have since moved on with life and worked briefly before enlistment to National Service. I hope to earn more money in future and be filial to my parents.” - Jervin Tay, aged 19, former resident of Singapore Boys’ Home, with his family and case worker Lim Li Min (seated, right). Currently, youth discharged from MSF Youth Homes are provided with post-care support for up to two months upon completion of their Court Orders. MSF will extend post-care support from two months to a year in a pilot programme to better strengthen the transition and reintegration of youth into the community. This builds on MSF’s work to support at-risk youth with opportunities to achieve success.

They started fostering in 2013, and are currently caring for 2 boys aged 4 and 7, and a girl aged 10. 
Mr Woo and Mdm Siti would love to have children of their own, but were unsuccessful, and hence considered fostering. “We saw fostering as a good start for us,” said Mr Woo. “We are able to do something to help the less fortunate and while contributing, we are also getting a taste of family life with children.

Based on their experience, their advice to those who are thinking of becoming foster parents is to learn as much as they can about fostering beforehand. “You are taking care of a child temporarily and you have to manage your expectations,” said Mdm Siti. 
On what fostering means to them, Mr Woo has this to say: “We are bringing them up while being very clear in our heads that we are doing this for them. We are doing this because we are able to provide the care that they need right now.” If you are keen to know more about the fostering scheme, visit www.msf.gov.sg/fostering.",1,52,2018-12-04T02:21:47.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/45730825_184327659188814_571375297510674128_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=tg9gdNfiMCgAX8KEI-Z&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT92BE8qYDK43IKpULGHSgxuDRG3eDIxKNSx13FbguRjpQ&oe=623F7641&_nc_sid=86f79a,1926612316871683345,2022-03-22T06:07:38.552Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This proved useful because early detection helped the children get access to proper medical treatment.

Today, childcare centres need to adhere to regulatory requirements set by the Early Childhood Development Agency to ensure the safety, well-being and welfare of children. For example, daily temperature and health checks are conducted, and reporting systems are in place to ensure that children promptly receive any needed follow-up.

Neighbourhood Health Services Kids and ECDA organized the first ever child health and development screening this weekend. It provides free screening for children 0-6 living in Boon Lay rental flats. Families and children are also linked up with social services and the community. The programme is a good example of two areas that we have been actively working on : First, moving upstream with preschool programmes and family support, so that every child can have a good start in life regardless of family circumstances. Second, it illustrates the collective impact we can achieve when partners across various sectors come together to integrate our services to better serve the multi-faceted needs of underprivileged families. A job well done by @nhskids with support from @temasekfoundationcares , ECDA, community agencies, Boon Lay YEC, Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society (THK) FSC, South West CDC, My First Campus, One Youth volunteers, and the many medical, dentistry, nursing and social work students and professionals who volunteered their time and energy for this very meaningful programme. @msfcares @singaporecares #desmond.lee",0,50,2018-07-03T08:45:06.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/35616335_271675370248198_8580657733223579648_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=s308uMCdO-YAX8fByw7&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_1dToie4vMs_pd2NOB5gjRqc8lB6CVR9KLxm6scxjrAg&oe=6240D4A6&_nc_sid=86f79a,1815189783226244670,2022-03-22T06:07:38.552Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,Desmond Lee,desmond.lee,,,"Boon Lay, Singapore",235355115,,,,,,

Vulnerable families who face a complex range of challenges need better coordinated help so that they can get back on their feet again. By coming together, government agencies, VWOs and companies can maximize resources to derive even better outcomes for such families.

Mr Othman’s visionary step of initiating the predecessor of the National Council of Social Service helped to create a more effective social service ecosystem. He also championed the training of social workers and volunteers to better equip them with skillsets needed.

Mdm Fong Wai Kheng has been a foster mother for the past 16 years. She first learnt about MSF’s Fostering Scheme through her mother-in-law, who herself was a foster parent for more than 30 years.

Despite having to deal with the loss of her husband in 2006, she soldiered on unselfishly to have provided care for a total of 18 children. Going the extra mile for her foster children, she identified their strengths and enrolled them in enrichment classes to help nurture their talents. Her adult children also helped to coach them in their studies.

She was part of the 232 volunteers who received the MSF Volunteer Awards last November. Our volunteers have tirelessly served in various areas, such as ensuring offenders successfully complete probation and fostering children.

The #DaretoCare movement highlights such acts of kindness, whether through simple gestures of care or volunteering efforts. 
We were tagged by Minister @chuanjin1. We tag @mccysg, @straits_times and @trybesg to post about an act of kindness and tag three friends to do the same, using #DaretoCare and #SGcares

https://www.instagram.com/p/BJaoCadD2u4/,"The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is greatly saddened by the passing of former President of Singapore, Mr S R Nathan. Over the years, Mr Nathan had guided us on how to do good, and how to do it well. His advice was simple – everything we do should serve the needs of the disadvantaged and improve the quality of their lives.  Mr Nathan’s care and concern for workers and clients in the social service sector had touched many lives and he will be fondly remembered. 
But beyond the time and effort spent by Mr Nathan in doing his part for charity, he has left us with a lasting legacy and system of empathy, care and concern for Singaporeans in need. His visionary step of establishing the President’s Challenge in the year 2000 had resulted in S$160 million raised for supported charities. Since then, more than 20,000 Singaporeans from all walks of life have also volunteered their time and skills for the President's Challenge Volunteer Drive. 
Mr Nathan’s life embodies the spirit of MSF’s mission: Resilience, strength and care. Our memories of Mr Nathan shall live on in these values that guide MSF and our officers’ work in helping Singaporeans.

Although Singapore’s landscape in managing special needs has evolved significantly over the last few years, what is even more crucial is that our society learnt to recognise the various disability issues, empower the PWDs with the right mindset and attitude, and provide them with the skills and opportunities to become integral contributors to society.

As mentioned by Minister @chuanjin1 everyone needs to adopt an inclusive mindset and see the persons for who they truly are, not their disability 😊

https://www.instagram.com/p/BH1xp_7jyFd/,"In 1967, the first batch of NUS Social Work students graduated with a degree in social work. At that time, social service as a field of study was dismissed as “merely vocational” and did not have any academic standing.
.
After years of hard work by two pioneers in the local social work education scene – Miss Jean Robertson and Mrs Ann Wee – the department of social work soon became one of international repute. Social work undergraduates are exposed to a wide range of fieldwork placements to gain necessary field-learning experience; with increasing demands for skills in areas like social work research and programme evaluation, management, staff development and social entrepreneurship.
.
Evolving overtime to keep up with changing times and social scenes, the social work education landscape has grown to include postgraduate studies.

Today, NUS offers a Masters of Social Work, Masters of Social Sciences (Social Work by Research) and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Social Sciences (Social Work by Research).
.
The picture above features three distinguished alumni from the NUS Department of Social Work – Ms Koh Wah Khoon, Dr S Vasoo and Mr Udhia Kumar – who were the inaugural recipients of the Ann Wee NUS Social Work Alumni Award; that recognises alumni who have made major contributions to the social work education and practice.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BHmF1WADlbs/,"Did you know that lonely people are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviours? This is especially worrying as Singapore is facing rapid ageing population and the number of seniors aged 65 and above, who live alone, has tripled since 2000. Studies have found that lonely seniors are more likely to report risky health behaviours such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and smoking. Conversely, social support can help encourage seniors to eat well, exercise, and live healthy lifestyles. Check out the various wellness programs available for seniors at www.successful-ageing.sg 😊 
Nonetheless, the most effective prevention is to maintain connections with your senior loved ones. After all, making an elderly feel loved and connected to the rest of the family is part of exercising filial piety.

.
A study has found that having a father present in a child's life can positively influence the child's emotional, social and behavioral development. On the other hand, girls with absent fathers tend to experience higher levels of emotional problems as compared to those without.
.
Did you also know that working dads, who spent more time with their kids, achieve better work-life balance and are happier overall? Study has shown that involved fathers are more satisfied with their jobs, had lesser conflicts in their home and are less likely to think of resigning from work.
.
With our recent legislative amendments, fathers of citizen children born from 1 January 2017 onwards are now entitled to an additional week of paid paternity leave! You can check out www.msf.gov.sg for more info. So fathers do spend more time with your kids, especially from their birth!
.
Since Father's Day is around the corner, we would like to take this opportunity to appreciate all the great dads out there and thank them for everything they do! 😊

The Ministry of Social Affairs – led by then Minister Othman Wok – took over a large slice of responsibilities that were previously held by the then Ministry of Labour, including overseeing the Social Welfare Department. The responsibilities falling under the new Ministry mainly involved the Country’s social welfare issues. Other facets that came under its jurisdiction include the Legal Aid Bureau, Registry of Muslim Marriages, Syariah Court, Registry of Marriages, Hindu Advisory Board and Sikh Advisory Board. 
Today, MSF oversees the country’s social issues – ranging from care for the needy and the disabled, to support for children and families – to build a more caring and resilient society.  #ThrowbackThursday #msfcares",0,15,2016-06-16T16:11:43.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,msfcares,MSF Singapore,https://scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/13385868_188727758191809_725729829_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-vie1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=VysftiukLc8AX8NgXYx&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT8iLXJGJTJoDkFMgN55XbInY7UX9mCW8NHfGexackDWIA&oe=62406378&_nc_sid=86f79a,1274007101039756908,2022-03-22T06:07:42.114Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Dato Lee Kong Chian as the President of its founding executive committee, the SCSS – which coordinated and promoted the roles and contributions of VWOs – provided remedial services, which then freed time for the government to focus on providing essential services such as housing and healthcare for the masses. 
In 1992, the SCSS was renamed the National Council of Social Service (NCSS). Today, the NCSS acts as a Statutory Board under MSF, acting as the national coordinating body for VWOs in Singapore.
