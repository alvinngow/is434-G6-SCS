It is inevitable for David and I to have disagreements sometimes but it is how we resolve them that matters. 10% of conflicts are due to difference of opinions. 90% are due to the hostility of voice and passive aggressive body language. 

Here are 5 simple but effective ways on how we try to resolve our marriage conflicts......

1) Give each other a chance to talk uninterrupted.
2) Listen to each other without judgement.
3) Use affirming words like "" I feel...."" and "" I hear you"" instead of "" You are always like that.""
4) Pray together.
5) Don't be afraid to say the magic words...."" I'm sorry and I love you!""üòå

But if you are facing deeper relationship or family issues, I will strongly encourage you to seek professional help as early as you can.

The Ministry of Social and Family Development, @msfcares has worked with the Community Psychology Hub (CPH) to provide an online counselling service for people facing marital, divorce, parenting, and/or family issues.

You can access CPH‚Äôs online counselling service through the new Family Assist portal (https:// go.gov.sg/onlinecounselling). This portal also provides information, resources and tips on decision making processes, not just for divorce, but also for reconciliation, or strengthening your marriage.

Marriage is about being a team. The harder you work together to make your marriage work, the stronger and healthier your relationship becomes. 

Love is not about how many years, months and days you have been together. It‚Äôs about how much you love, honour and cherish each other every single day.  Âä†Ê≤πÔºÅ

.
‚ÄúAs a psychologist, I can tell you that I see in the counselling room the damage this can do across a lifetime. Adults young and old suppressing feelings and needs in relationships (and life) to the point they are so incredibly depressed and unhappy they finally see a professional. Often, people disengage from their emotional selves, pushing loved ones away when they need them most and even explode with anger because so much resentment has built.
.
Sure, mental health isn‚Äôt black and white, and people‚Äôs brains are different. However, a lot of the suffering I see in my therapeutic work can be linked to behaviour patterns in relationships. Patterns of people-pleasing, not asking for help and not telling people how they feel for fear of being dismissed, shamed or rejected.
.
The Circle of Security (COS) Parenting program @circleofsecurity changed the way I saw my daughter, the way I interpreted her less-cooperative behaviours, or her being upset about things that didn‚Äôt seem like such a big deal‚Äîto me. It really helped me to see her respectfully as her own person, with her own valid responses to things without trying to change what she was feeling.‚Äù
.
COS takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Seeing behaviour as connection seeking rather that attention seeking.
‚Ä¢ Holding a sense that your child is good even when they are ‚Äòmisbehaving‚Äô.
‚Ä¢ Responding to anger and strong emotions (yours and theirs!)
‚Ä¢ Letting go of labels like- ‚Äòneedy‚Äô demanding, attention seeking, a problem child.
‚Ä¢ Learning about and managing your emotional triggers.
‚Ä¢ How to find that balance of being firm and loving.
‚Ä¢ Considering a parenting approach without punishments and time outs.

‚ÄúWomen, on the other hand, did the opposite ‚Äì when they viewed men under conditions of uncertainty, on average they tended to underestimate the men‚Äôs attractiveness,‚Äù Ms Evans said.

Have you witnessed parents physically abusing their children? Or spouses hurling insults at one another in public? How can we remain vigilant and pick up on cases of family abuse before things go too far?

James and I believe that love should be at the root in all we do and so we talked about how this belief needs to be reflected in our parenting.

In the case of spousal abuse, a couple could appear loving and stable on the outside but be in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship behind closed doors. Apart from physical abuse, it could be verbal insults, put downs, over-controlling behaviour, non-consensual sexual advances or even financial oppression.

With the surge in abuse cases in recent times, we need to step out of our shells, come forward to intervene and no longer view it as a ‚Äúprivate matter‚Äù. Family violence is real and prevalent in our society and we need to work together to stand against it, and stop it.

The Break The Silence campaign by the Ministry of Social and Family development @msfcares aims to raise awareness of family violence and encourages bystanders to safely step in and intervene if they come across cases of family violence.

Many victims could be suffering in silence without a safe way to reach out for help. The ‚ÄúSignal for Help‚Äù hand gesture (swipe this carousel) provides victims a discreet way of showing that they need help, and bystanders seeing this gesture should offer their assistance.

Learn how to identify the gesture and what to do in the event you witness family violence. Head over to¬†http://www.msf.gov.sg/breakthesilence¬†to read up more!

I work hard every day with one goal in mind, to provide for my family.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to hear that ever since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, there has been a great rise in the number of abuse cases, especially during the circuit breaker period.

I‚Äôve partnered up with the Ministry of Social & Family Development @msfcares to spread the message about the Break The Silence campaign which aims to raise awareness about family violence.

If you are married or in a committed relationship, spousal abuse can come in the form of:

‚óè Physical Abuse: slapping, shoving, punching, wrongful confinement
‚óè Emotional and Psychological Abuse: verbal insults and put-downs, accuse you of something you did not do, controlling your finances or who you meet
‚óè Sexual Abuse: forcing sexual activities onto you, unwanted sexual advances and harassment such as fondling and groping

Family violence is not just a private matter and everyone has a duty to stop it.

With the Signal for Help hand gesture, we hope to create a medium for victims to break the silence & seek help in a safe manner. Raising awareness & understanding this important gesture will allow family members, friends & even bystanders to step in and intervene if they come across any cases of abuse.

Nikhil and I have been married for more than 18 years now with our share of ups and downs, but a good understanding and respect has always helped us both!

But then it is not the same with every couple around. Family violence , comes in various forms such as physical abuse, emotional/ psychological abuse, sexual abuse or even financial abuse.

 We need to understand that it can affect anyone and it is time to #BreakTheSilence.

I have partnered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development @msfcares to spread the message about the Break The Silence campaign which aims to raise awareness about family violence, and encourage bystanders to lend help if anyone is experiencing family violence.

If you are married or in a committed relationship, you could be experiencing spousal abuse with these signs and symptoms:
‚Ä¢ Physical: slapping, shoving, punching, wrongful confinement
‚Ä¢ Emotional and Psychological: verbal insults and put-downs, accuse you of something you did not do, controlling your finances or who you meet
‚Ä¢ Sexual: forcing sexual activities onto you, unwanted sexual advances and harassment
such as fondling and groping

Through the Signal for Help, victims are able to ask for help in a safe and discreet manner. Anyone who sees someone using the gesture, please respond by:
‚Ä¢ Asking general ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù questions to reduce risk and make it easier for them to respond 
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt respond immediately, whether physical or online
‚Ä¢ Only reach out by using another form of communication (text, Whatsapp, social media, email etc)

These four years have been filled with wonderful memories, but also difficult conversations, tears, disagreements, which eventually always ended with hugs. Thankfully. 

Marriage is filled with responsibilities, home, children... It can feel like too much to shoulder sometimes. If you‚Äôre facing challenges in your marriage, feel helpless, seeking reconciliation, or considering divorce, you can find information, resources and tips on Family Assist. Family Assist is an online resource portal that provides support for couples looking to strengthen their marriage or find help on any marital issues. You will be able to find tips on building a strong marriage. The portal will also provide tips on how to better manage conflicts.

If you and your spouse have decided to proceed with a divorce, you will be able to find information on how to co-parent after divorce, and how a divorce can impact your children, housing options and finances. The Budget Calculator on the portal can help you better understand how divorce may stretch or strain your finances. You can also sign up for the Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP), and find information and resources to help you and your family during this period of transition.

You can speak to a counsellor online and seek support through a free-of-charge online counselling service by the Community Psychology Hub, in collaboration with @msfcares. This service allows for anonymous sign-ups so you can be rest assured that your privacy will not be compromised. 

If you are facing marital, divorce and/or co-parenting difficulties, you may want to visit Family Assist at https://familyassist.msf.gov.sg. Alternatively, if you know anyone facing similar difficulties, you may also want to share about the portal with them.

Having a great partner in this union is what ultimately makes the marriage work. Grateful for you, @weipei88. I love how we always overcome our differences with lots of compromise and communication. Lots and lots of it. Happy 4th anniversary, baobi!

.
‚ÄúPain, depression, and anxiety travel through similar pathways along your nervous system and share many of the same biological mechanisms. One of the areas in the brain that receives pain signals ‚Äî specifically, the limbic region ‚Äî shares many of the same messengers as the mood signals. We know from research studies using neuroimaging that the parts of the brain controlling emotion and sensory features of pain are altered in people with chronic pain.
‚Ä¶
There is a direct correlation between improvement in one‚Äôs emotional well-being and their experience of pain (and vice versa). Chronic pain increases the risk of depression and anxiety, and depression and anxiety strongly predict the development of chronic pain. This association is seen in conditions like fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, where behavioural and psychological treatment strategies have shown benefit in reducing symptoms.‚Äù
.
Psychologists can help address‚Äî
Pain catastrophizing: This is when you magnify the negative effects of pain and focus on feelings of helplessness while ruminating about the presence of pain in your life. Negative thoughts and beliefs about pain often lead to worsened emotional and social functioning and a decreased response to medical interventions for pain.
Fear of pain: Concern or worry about an injury drives avoidant or protective behaviours. The anticipation of an increased sensation of pain may limit you from engaging in physical activity or attending social outings. Pain-avoidant behaviours can lead to physical deconditioning and further decreased quality of life.
Pain acceptance: This is a challenging, but highly effective technique focused on developing an accepting attitude towards the pain. It involves doing your best to nonjudgmentally acknowledge the presence of pain and minimise unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that won‚Äôt make pain better.
Trauma: The link between prior trauma and chronic pain is becoming better understood. Psychological therapies can address ongoing physical and emotional stress responses linked to traumatic experiences.",The Psychology Practice,1304234999624574,Photo,Dr Jade Kua,drjadekua,Expat Living Singapore,expatlivingsg,,auspsychologicalsociety,Psychology Today,psych_today,2755782136420980963_5502248997,2022-03-22T12:44:53.234Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares,MSF Singapore,msfcares,SG Psychological Society,singaporepsychologicalsociety,Health Promotion Board,hpbsg,,Chen Yiming,sgdrwellness,The Psychology Practice,thepsychpractice,Vitacare Family Clinic,vitacarefamily,psychoanalysis.sg,psychoanalysis.sg,MentalHealthAwareness Workshop,murdochsgmentalhealth,Fitivate,feel_fitivated,Murdoch Singapore üá∏üá¨,murdochsgp,Harvard Health,harvard_health,Mentally-Healthy,mentallyhealthyaustralia,Singapore Medical Association,sgartforhcw,"Ministry of Health, Singapore",moh_singapore,SPS Youth Wing,spsyouthwing,Project: It‚Äôll Be Alright,itllbealright.sg

And yes, all of these things are overwhelming. 
.
But what we don‚Äôt often hear about is how triggering the holiday season can be, specifically if you live with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) or come from a relational trauma background. Many people have strained, estranged or just plain painful relationships with their family of origin and/or their partner‚Äôs family of origin, which can make the holidays difficult.
.
It‚Äôs not uncommon in these situations for folks to spend the entire calendar year dreading the winter holidays. The last six weeks of the year can feel especially triggering for C-PTSD symptoms.
.
If this is you and you dread the holidays, or if you know that the holiday season might trigger your C-PTSD symptoms, bear in mind these very important self-care points that could help you this holiday season.

Every year we try to keep your needs in mind, and that includes the individuals who are hurting and do not relate to the holiday cheer at all.
.
The year-end season can be associated with loss, trauma, and severe emotional pain, which can remind of how uncomfortable and frequently inconsolable it can be. Hence, there is no amount of sugar-coating or positivity bullsh*t that can cover up the reality of life. Besides, the past two years has been absolutely dismal although we've made it this far!
.
HOLD ON! Before this might sound like a weird Christmas greeting that's gone nightmarishly wrong, we encourage you all to stay close to your loved ones, or at least stay safe in your most secure space. Cuddle up, watch some TV, or go occupy yourself with your favourite past time for a good moment [you know best]. If your TPP therapist goes on break, it doesn't mean that you're no longer thought of - On the contrary, you're always kept in mind and that also means understanding how you may feel when they are not present for the time being.

Was glad to have been a part of the twin celebration for the 50th and 25th anniversaries of the Volunteer Probation Officer (VPO) and Community Service (CS) schemes before I flew for Bahrain! üéâ

During the event, I spoke to ‚ÄòEmily‚Äô (not her real name), a probationer who shared her community service experience with the Marsiling Youth Network (YN), and how it helped her find her footing in the community. Emily once faced rejection for her past mistakes. Through her community service placement with the YN, she slowly regained her confidence, as her involvement affirmed her potential and she was given opportunities to build on her strengths. üí™üèºüí™üèº

Such stories reflect the transformative power that our community partners have in nurturing our youths. We are grateful to our VPOs and CS agencies, for your strong partnership with MSF Singapore (@msfcares) in supporting our probationers in community rehabilitation! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

The journey is not always easy, but your perseverance, patience and passion have been most inspiring and heart-warming! Let‚Äôs all continue to build a village of care and support to guide and mentor them so they can press on and realise their true potential. üëçüèªüëçüèª

If you have 5mins, watch this video for an #unfiltered sharing by our probationers, VPOs, and friends from our CS agencies.

So, don‚Äôt just ride the mindfulness trend, it‚Äôs just one aspect of psychological functioning. Furthermore, it‚Äôs an entirely different approach toward living that if just treated as an intervention, we might pay for it dearly with certain psychological consequences.
.
The ability to observe one‚Äôs emotions is also touted as a major benefit of mindfulness, and for many of us, this is indeed true. Yet can it go too far? Can we become too distanced from our experience? Indeed we can. Britton (2019) reviews multiple studies showing connections between meditation training and blunted emotionality and even dissociation for some participants.
.
Sometimes mindfulness practices are taught to help us overcome avoidance, as a way of ‚Äúbeing with‚Äù that which is difficult. Again, much of the time this can offer great benefit. However, the reality is that some people don‚Äôt struggle as much with avoidance but instead become preoccupied with their troubles. For such individuals, the instruction to stay with a challenging experience may not be beneficial and could even be counterproductive.
.
There tends to be a ‚Äúmore is better‚Äù attitude among mindfulness practitioners, where the answer to whatever ails you can easily become ‚Äúpractice more mindfulness.‚Äù Britton (2019) reminds us of the importance of paying attention to the duration of practice and where there might be diminishing returns or even harmful effects. For instance, she reviews research suggesting that meditation may help sleep only up to a certain amount, after which it may actually make sleep more difficult.

.
With changing gender roles resulting from rising educational attainment and female labour force participation, women also increasingly expect an egalitarian partnership in financial contribution, emotional engagement, and household labour.
.
When a marriage ceases to satisfy these needs and expectations or even becomes harmful to one‚Äôs physical and mental health, divorce becomes rational and necessary.
.
No-fault divorce will not encourage divorce or discourage marriage, but it will make the divorce process less acrimonious for those who are already determined to end a counterproductive marriage.
.
If divorcing couples could part on more amicable terms, it would help them and their children to adapt and move on in life more quickly.
.
It benefits no one to drag out an unhappy marriage in a lengthy and agonising process of divorce.

I‚Äôve partnered up with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to raise awareness for the Break The Silence campaign, and encourage bystanders to lend a helping hand and encourage victims to seek help if they know of anyone suffering from family violence.

Last weekend, I visited the good people (Pastor Reuben, Asst. Pastor Shannon & team) at Faith Methodist Church, Singapore. Visited the Safe, Sound Sleeping Place (S3P) that they‚Äôd set up within the church compounds and spoke with 3 rough sleepers who were seeking refuge in the S3P. 

The issue of rough sleeping is close to my heart. I read the commentary by Dr Harry Tan and team on homelessness on 16 Nov, titled ‚ÄúHelping the homeless beyond putting a roof over their heads‚Äù and I am truly thankful for the partnerships we‚Äôd formed in the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) Network.

Other than operating S3Ps, our PEERS partners go on regular night walks to befriend our rough sleeping friends. I join them and our MSF colleagues on these night walks and I‚Äôm grateful for the community of support we‚Äôd built up since the Network was formed.

I also shared my views and MSF Singapore's approach toward rough sleeping in the ST Forum page today. We all can play a part in helping our rough sleeping friends. If you come across rough sleepers who may need support or shelter, please call the ComCare Hotline at 1800-222-0000 or email the PEERS Office at msf_peersoffice@msf.gov.sg.

Take bathing @howisethan for example, the only reason why he is clean is because his father has been showering him since the day he came home. The first few times were uncomfortable but eventually bathing became their father and son bonding time. Whew!

Gone are the days when dads just play with their kids and leave the hard part to the moms! It‚Äôs 2021 and so glad to see a lot of dads equally caring for their kids from feeding them milk and solids, changing their diapers to washing their clothes. The only things they probably can‚Äôt do is latching and giving birth but that‚Äôs not really within their control. 

So to my husband @neoquadra, thank you for loving and annoying (see reel for reference) your son. Keep it up and to all the dads out there, know what we appreciate you and all that you do for the family! 

To borrow a quote, ‚ÄúAny man can be a father, but it takes someone special to a dad.‚Äù

.
Q8. When and why should I bring my child to see a psychologist? What are the factors that I should look for to bring my child to a psychologist before it is too late?
.
Andrea: One key area of concern would be significant changes to their daily functioning or behaviour such as prolonged changes in their mood where they can be more withdrawn or irritable and when they are showing expressions of self-harm or suicidal ideation. Trust your parental instincts and do note that it is never too late to attend to a child and to offer them support.
‚Ä¶
Q10. If I need to bring my child to a therapist, how can I explain this to him?
.
Andrea: Depending on the age of the child, gently point out your concerns about their mental health and ask if they might like to speak to someone who can help. You may provide more information about what a psychologist or therapist does.
.
One way would be to explain that when our bodies are not well. For example, when we display cold/flu symptoms, we see a doctor to help us feel better ‚Äì hence it would be the same when our mind/heart is not well. When we feel sad, anxious or angry a lot, therefore we see a psychologist or therapist to help us feel better. If the child is resistant to the idea, do not coerce them but continue offering them support while also encouraging them to get help.

But first, we need to understand why these individuals with special needs have these struggles, then we can assist them.
.
Here are some tips to approach the conversation:
(1) Normalise what they are feeling and help them identify their emotions.
(2) Don't overload them with information, as it can be overwhelming.
(3) Remind them that there is always people around to support them.
(4) Link them up with the relevant professionals.

For instance, a survey found that 85% of participants aged 18 to 24 were dissatisfied with their body (Baker, 2018). From 2016 to 2020, there was an average of 300 patients per year who received treatment for various eating disorders from Singaporean public hospitals, with a median patient age of 21 years old (Khan, 2021). Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which is one of the few hospitals in Singapore with a multidisciplinary and specialised team for treating EDs, also sees patients who usually present symptoms between 17 to 22 years old (Baker, 2018).
.
Despite an increase in global prevalence of Eating Disorders, there is little conversation and awareness surrounding this issue, especially among peers of the tertiary age group. In collaboration with @nus_singapore students, TPP Clinical Psychologist Ms. Lynette Tan was interviewed for her professional views. This ebook will help raise awareness about ED and normalise discussions about mental wellness, body image, and developing a healthy relationship with food and exercise.

You might find this to be quite an illuminating article. We suggest this article to leaders and Human Resources of your organisation, as a psychological way of understanding employee dynamics. Perhaps an organisational psychologist might be useful as a consideration for your business.
.
Here‚Äôs some highlights:
‚Ä¢ People high in narcissism seem to have considerable success in many domains in life, including at work‚Äîfor example, they get promoted fast.
‚Ä¢ Narcissistic employees‚Äô promotability may be due to their impression management skills and, especially, their displays of power.
‚Ä¢ Using the same techniques narcissists employ, such as displaying more power, may help non-narcissistic employees get the promotions they deserve.
.
‚ÄúIn general, making promotability assessments is more difficult than many other types of assessments (e.g., performance review). Why? Because promotability assessments are based less on concrete information regarding an employee‚Äôs success on a particular project and more on intangible qualities, like cues of future potential. These cues, of course, include displays of power, something narcissists tend to know how to do very well.‚Äù

We hark back to the earlier days of TPP where we continue to help others cultivate psychological thinking, which is such an important capacity of ours in daily functioning. Let‚Äôs stoke our thinking today, considering what needs to be considered in this potentially confusing process.
.
There is NO one size fits all - It is good to start by asking yourself what you are seeking in therapy! Your NEEDS and GOALS can be explored, and further developed with your therapist.
.
Some needs may require a different focus and approach, especially since one's struggles can be acute or longstanding, and differ in terms of its severity. Therefore, two evidence-based forms of effective therapies are suggested here as a useful way to jumpstart your search. Remember, if you're in doubt, always consult a credible source who can point you in the right direction.

‚Äî Even if it‚Äôs difficult, admit you were wrong and share only your remorse.
.
‚ÄúWe tell children, ‚ÄòGo apologise to your brother,‚Äô but they can learn more by experiencing you apologising to them,‚Äù says Jeremy Ruckstaetter, a professor of counseling at Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Mo. When Ruckstaetter started researching apologies in graduate school, he found perplexingly few studies focusing on apologies from parents to children. For his doctoral dissertation, he surveyed 327 parents and found that those who regularly apologised to their children reported stronger attachment bonds.
.
Yes, parents need to display a remorse and take charge of their own responses. When you show that your apology is unconditional (meaning that you don‚Äôt make them pay in your next sentence), they learn from your display and know that it‚Äôs possible to take that stance. This teaches them about humility, pride and that apologies can mend relational problems and increase intimacy! Read on to learn more.

Dr. Murray is also a practicing clinical psychologist, involved nationally with the training and accreditation of clinical psychologists. His major research interest is the chronobiology of mood, especially the relationship between sleep, circadian function, and positive mood states, and he has over 100 publications in this area. The majority of his work follows a collaborative and multi-disciplinary framework. Greg is a co-author on the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists‚Äô Mood Disorder Guidelines, and wrote the Australian Psychological Society‚Äôs guidelines for psychological treatment of bipolar disorder. He is currently leading a 4-year project to develop and test a new online intervention (ORBIT) for people who have had a large number of episodes of bipolar disorder.

TW // ABUSE

EP 33: When affections turn into abuse (with Zionette Esther)

Zionette Esther's story of abuse is an important one to tell. She shares about how she first met her ex-husband, how they fell in love and out of it. It all started when her honeymoon turned into a ""horror-moon"" and due to a series of events, the verbal outbursts gradually led to physical violence. Over time, she learnt to open up to her family and friends about her situation and with their help, managed to escape her narcissistic ex-husband, leaving him for good. We hope that Zionette's story can help those who are facing similar situations to have the courage to do what is right by them.

I was informed that therapy is not a quick solution. In fact, it will take at least three months to get somewhere and can take up to a few years to heal all those years of trauma.

Through therapy, I now understand that it was because deep down inside me, I felt that no one ever stood up for me so I feel the need to stand up for the weak and unfairly treated.

.
We all think we know how to take good are of ourselves: eat your veggies, work out and try to get enough sleep. But how many of us know that social connection is just as critical?
.
One landmark study showed that lack of social connection is a greater detriment to health than obesity, smoking and high blood pressure.
.
On the other hand, strong social connection:
‚Ä¢ leads to a 50% increased chance of longevity
‚Ä¢ strengthens your immune system(research by Steve Cole shows that genes impacted by loneliness also code for immune function and inflammation)
‚Ä¢ helps you recover from disease faster
‚Ä¢ may even lengthen your life!
.
People who feel more connected to others have lower levels of anxiety and depression. Moreover, studies show they also have higher self-esteem, greater empathy for others, are more trusting and cooperative and, as a consequence, others are more open to trusting and cooperating with them. In other words, social connectedness generates a positive feedback loop of social, emotional and physical well-being.
.
Unfotunately, the opposite is also true for those who lack social connectedness. Low levels of social connection are associated with declines in physical and psychological health as well as a higher likelihood for antisocial behavior that leads to further isolation. Learn more, look us up!

.
What do you reckon? More issues or more awareness? Either way, it‚Äôs good news people are beginning to care about their own backyard and feel their personal issues are legitimate. [HOWEVER] If you‚Äôre a mental health professional, seek help, manage your caseload, get therapy, do something. Why? Strap in for the long-term, because the responsibility of self-care falls on (you guessed it!) yourSELF, and not on your organisation. The way things are going, we can only expect more individuals to come forward for help, which means more burnout and less stability for the provision of treatment. Dear employers, do cut your staff some slack, it‚Äôs already tough as it is as a mental health worker. They need all the support they can get.

However, the ugly truth is that according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), ‚ÄòPaedophilia‚Äô or individuals with paedophilic tendencies, NEVER go into remission ‚Äî It is an insidious and dangerous aspect of an individual‚Äôs psychological structure that requires ongoing management and accountability apart from legal recourse and punishment.

We need a growing psychological awareness of disturbing issues in our community. Remember, according to the research, many of these sexual offences occur in the family home. If you‚Äôre concerned with your own situation and have feared making a report, it may be time to alert the necessary authorities. Start by telling someone safe so you don‚Äôt remain silent. Please do not underestimate the psychological consequences of these acts.

.
The increasing openness towards discussing youth mental health and emotions may be hard for parents to relate to, since they did not grow up in the same context and use of particular ways of describing one‚Äôs concerns.
.
As such, being curious and empathising with their teen‚Äôs feelings and experiences will help parents better support their child‚Äôs transition to adulthood. Providing a listening ear is better than jumping in with advice, although professional help should be sought when necessary.
.
Five things to note:
‚Ä¢ Having good grades does not mean I am okay
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt glamorise or downplay mental illness
‚Ä¢ Give me time to recover
‚Ä¢ It is hard to quit social media when Instagram is your diary
‚Ä¢ Believe me when I say I am in pain

Even though we have reduced face to face meetings over the last few weeks, the GRLs and I have been working hard to connect with agencies and VWOs so that we can better render help to the vulnerable in our community. We had very fruitful discussions and agreed on further collaboration opportunities.

Today, we met Blossom Seeds, a not-for-profit organization that supports our seniors in NSL.  One of the more popular services has been the Medical Escort & Transport services that they provide to our residents.  I am delighted that their Chairman Mr Aw and CEO Siew Chin have reaffirmed that commitment strengthen their partnership with NSL. We also agreed to support their recruitment for volunteers to support our neighbourhood so that we can expand the services.

Recently, we also meet with Yishun Social Service Office (SSO) team led by Mdm Salmiah.  The team briefed us on the Support schemes available and also clarified our questions.  We also agreed to help reach out to residents who need urgent help yet have not provided the full information for financial assistance.

With thanks to the Blossom Seeds team and SSO team for the help given to the vulnerable in our community. I am sure our partnership with strengthen further for the benefit of residents. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Students at the primary school level are reporting symptoms of anxiety and stress related to school, where extreme cases have driven them to suicide. Youths often face long days at school, hours of homework, and are then pushed by parents to have private tuition. This creates an impact on mental wellbeing, with rising numbers seeking psychiatric help as they struggle to cope with the relentless pressure for academic excellence.

Statistics by the Samaritans of Singapore show that suicide is the leading cause of death for those aged 10 to 29 with 452 lives lost to suicide in 2020 alone. This includes a 37.5 per cent increase from 2019 for the age group of 10 to 19. Education Minister, Mr Chan Chun Sing, has also acknowledged that the overall increase in suicides in young people this year have been due to the Covid-19 pandemic aggravating existing stressors. This pushes the notion of student welfare and mental wellbeing to be of utmost importance.

If you need help, please reach out to @samaritansofsingapore, @samhsingapore, Institute of Mental Health Singapore, @ncss.sg and @beyondthelabelsg.

Although it is now recognised as dangerous pseudoscience by the medical establishment, and banned in 20 U.S. states, conversion therapy remains endemic in many conservative, religious communities‚Äîand as ‚ÄòPray Away‚Äô documents, is grounding a new generation of believers in its rhetoric as part of larger culture wars being waged over gay and trans rights. But many of the movement‚Äôs early leaders and figureheads have since recanted [‚Äòroti prata‚Äô-ed]; in many cases coming out (or back out) as gay and speaking out about the harm they experienced‚Äîand that they caused.
.
When you believe you‚Äôre doing the right thing, and you‚Äôre doing it also in the name of religion, it can put you into a deep place of denial. This is the fuel of what continues conversion therapy and the movement more generally into the present day, despite the undeniable evidence that it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîand that it causes trauma.

On CNA Insider] ‚ÄòWith school counsellors, it‚Äôs really hit-or-miss‚Äô: Behind the challenge of safeguarding student mental health ‚Äî There is a disparity in student experiences when it comes to school counselling!
.
As recent events throw a spotlight on the mental health of Singapore‚Äôs youth, questions have been raised on how equipped schools are to help this generation. Students, teachers and counsellors tell CNA Insider the problems, conflicts and the way forward.
.
While a handful of people shared positive experiences, there were common complaints that the counsellors belittled the students‚Äô problems by making comparisons with others, or that the counsellors would ‚Äúsnitch‚Äù on them to their teachers or parents.
.
For some, students go to school counsellors because they need an escape from academics. But when they go to the school counsellor, they end up talking more about academics. It‚Äôs kind of counter-intuitive.
.
Whilst some can overlook the snitching and need a listening ear, ‚ÄúIt feels like a very shameful thing, and I guess being in a school environment, people gossip. I was really scared people would see me going to the counsellor and think something‚Äôs wrong with me,‚Äù a student said.

Travel restrictions due to closed borders brought about by Covid-19 also led to the demise of some long-distance relationships. Whilst it is true that a lack of physical contact and quality time spent with each other bears some importance to the development of romantic relationships, maybe it is a good time to evaluate what is it that we look out for that keeps us sufficiently maintained in (or out of) our relationships. This includes our relational insecurities.

Students prefer their teachers to counsellors for mental health support but ‚Äòteacher-counsellors‚Äô is NOT a good idea. Why do we say that? Let‚Äôs see.
.
The role of a teacher and the role of a counsellor are unique and significant in the way one operates in a school. In order for a teacher to be effective, they need to provide instruction, whilst being emotionally accessible to their students as it helps with interpersonal connection. However, counsellors are therapists and have a very different professional relationship with their clients. For counsellors to be effective for their clients, they are required to exercise good boundaries and have limited contact in the scope of the goals of counselling. Hence, by lumping these two significantly different roles essentially muddles up the role of a teacher or counsellor, thereby inhibiting the effectiveness of either role. Coupled with the added stress of needing to train to be an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù counsellor, whilst being a competent teacher, we may have introduced an insurmountable layer of psychological stress for the teacher needing to play multiple roles over and above an already stressful occupation, despite news of reducing their workload. It‚Äôs like telling a mother or father that they need to take on the role of their spouse in addition to their current role ‚Äî is it possible to lessen one‚Äôs workload to mitigate the stressful situation? The solution will have to be an explicit and separate role for teachers and counsellors. Perhaps it‚Äôs better to go back to the drawing board and consult our professional bodies like the @singaporepsychologicalsociety before being reactive to the notion of being ‚Äòill-equipped‚Äô.

Too many video conferences can lead to what is now nicknamed ""Zoom fatigue."" New research shows how employers and tech companies can maintain the positive aspects of remote work while reducing the psychological drain, particularly for women.
.
The article describes ‚Äúhypergaze,‚Äù an intense feeling that the other people on the call are staring at you, because the video conferencing display shows everyone looking toward their cameras no matter who their focus is actually on. It‚Äôs even worse in one-on-one meetings, when your colleague‚Äôs face appears so large on the screen, it‚Äôs as if they are standing less than two feet away.
.
‚ÄúThis kind of physical proximity that is mimicked by video conference is perceived by the brain as a situation that would lead either to mating or to conflict,‚Äù says Fauville. ‚ÄúThis is very intense for the brain.‚Äù

It is also not possible for teachers who are already overloaded with work to delve deeply into issues affecting one student as this requires close monitoring, observation and engagement, she added.

It makes me chuckle a little when someone praises my husband for being so hands-on. Sure appreciation is merited but not because he is helping me out but because he is fulfilling his responsibility to equally care for the baby and our home. I understand where this old school thinking is coming from but a lot has changed since then and perspectives should too. 

It‚Äôs an obsolete concept where moms are considered the primary caregiver unless the couple has decided for one of them to be a stay-at-home parent, I say parent because it can either be the mom or the dad. In our case, I feel my husband is better suited to be a SAHD if given the choice because he is more patient and a homebody. 

I see mixed feedback where other fathers are happily doing their part with this equal parenting while some can do more. And that‚Äôs okay because parenting is a learning journey. No one is perfect and that transcends to being a parent. Parenthood is tough but what matters is the love, care and attention we put in for our child, our spouse and the family in totality.

So thank you @neoquadra for being an awesome dad. We love you and hope you never get tired of feeding, bathing, caring, playing, talking and reading books to our son, @howisethan. Like I mentioned to you during his first week of existence, you are doing great! 

Appreciating and celebrating all the fathers and father figures out there because they deserve it too!

Curious! Do you prefer that both parents work or one be a SAHM / SAHD?

Due to the recent occurrences you‚Äôve heard reported in the news, it‚Äôs not difficult to imagine it invites the fury and frustration from scores of our community against the irresponsible actions of a certain few. From Thursday (July 22) till Aug 18, Singapore will revert to phase two (heightened alert) with tighter measures in place to curb the worsening Covid-19 situation.
.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday said the new measures will supersede those previously announced on July 19.
.
Please take note:
1. Cap on group sizes reduced to two
2. Dining in and other mask-off activities banned once more
3. Limits for live events cut to 100
4. Capacity caps for attractions, malls to be cut
5. Mandatory SafeEntry check-in for all markets, hawker centres
6. More support measures for affected businesses

Our heart goes out to the families on both sides, and others in the immediate vicinity who were afflicted.

Why do we love superheroes so much? I like to think it‚Äôs because we all need a bit of rescuing from time to time. Whether you were bullied at the playground or workplace, or experienced extremes of severe trauma in your life, we had all encountered ordeals where we wished we had been rescued. But superheroes need rescuing too - they face grief, personal tragedies, moral dilemmas and no-win scenarios - but they also show us how we can cope in the face of insurmountable odds. 

I am no superhero, despite the hashtag #docbydaysuperherobynight I wish I were - but no amount of gamma radiation, or superhuman serum, is going to turn me into one. I use humour as my ""superpower"" though - as I firmly believe that laughter is the best medicine. 

But trauma is no laughing matter.

I recently learnt that two-thirds of people in Singapore have experienced at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives, and that in 2020, @msfcares handled significantly more child abuse cases compared to the preceding 6 years. Growing up with considerable trauma can cause them to project these negative emotions into their own actions - most times at a subconscious level. It is thus on us as a caring society to be aware of these trauma and how it can impact on the community‚Äôs mental health. We must better identify the at-risk population by being more trauma-informed, in order to provide support to these victims, or to direct them to seek professional help.

Remember. Clowns cry too, and sometimes the widest grins can hide the saddest tears. These persons could be anyone around you. And it might even be you.

Mindfulness has become over-hyped, misunderstood, and overly commodified. The documented robust health effects are overstated and not enough health professionals are talking about the unknowns or downsides. There are other ways to self-soothe besides mindfulness; it's one of many tools in the toolbox. We know there is no substitute for good old psychotherapy. Your needs are always kept in mind.

Even the bully, oppressor and perpetrator could have adverse childhood experiences that contributed to their manifestations. 

Trauma comes in many forms and traumatic events include anything from being bullied in school, parental divorce, sudden loss of a loved one, witnessed or experienced domestic violence, to sexual harassment or abuse.

I was quite stunned to find out that nearly 64% of people in Singapore have reported experiencing at least one traumatic event during the first 18 years of their lives. It is also worrying to read that in 2020, @msfcares handled 44.6% more child abuse cases compared to 6 years before. 

Growing up with trauma can cause victims to project their trauma unto their actions. Hence, it is important for us as a society to be aware of trauma and how it relates to mental health. Being more trauma-informed, we can then better identify the vulnerable population, provide support and care to distressed victims, or encourage them to seek professional help if needed.

If we are afraid to deal with our own anger or express it in a useful way, it is almost inevitable that our children will struggle with being able to do so. Guess where they would have internalised these emotional regulation dynamics from? So, let‚Äôs start from the beginning. By showing our children how they can express their anger confidently and communicatively, it will help them in ways that pay exponential dividends psychologically and interpersonally. Don‚Äôt squander it away by discouraging their display of anger or worse, to suppress or ‚Äògaslight‚Äô their incendiary experiences. Remember, suppressed emotions will always come back in uglier ways. Your needs are always kept in mind.

.
THERE‚ÄôS MORE TO MARRIAGE THAN THE BIG DAY
Ms Lynette Tan, a Clinical Psychologist at The Psychology Practice, says that holding a wedding during these times can present an opportunity for couples to reflect on what the occasion means to them. ‚ÄúThey can ask themselves if there is the pressure of having to conform to certain practices that may not actually be meaningful to them as a couple. Instead, they can think about how the wedding can be conducted in a way that is more representative of who they are or even consider personalising the experience for their guests, which may be hard to do on a larger scale. ‚ÄòSmaller scale‚Äô does not mean it has to be any less memorable.‚Äù
.
KEEP CALM AND MARRY ON!
If you are disappointed and/or frustrated with changes to your wedding plans, Ms Lynette Tan suggests that you tune in to how you feel, and be kind to yourself and your partner. Also, it is vital to talk it out ‚Äî after all, the pandemic can understandably lead to worries such as financial security, or starting a family. Find an appropriate time to have conversations about these issues. When your partner shares his or her feelings, respond gently. Recognise that it‚Äôs normal to feel some pressure.

.
As a way to understand this, we look to two specific areas of development that inform our work, namely Attachment (Mary Ainsworth) and the separation‚Äìindividuation process (Margaret Mahler): Two ways of looking at the mother‚Äìinfant relationship. One can conceptualise the therapeutic relationship as a mental representation of how we learn to resolve our interpersonal and psychological relationships with others. This is a crucial element in the way we advocate for the healing of attachment injuries, since many of our clients had devastating experiences separating and individuating from others in their lives ‚Äî this interplay extends from the time we spend in our mother‚Äôs womb to when we enter our tomb. Just as our clients seek meaning in their experiences, we wish to provide a safe and secure context for those repeated overtures for care, nurturance and understanding. Your needs are kept in mind.

During his first year at @republicpoly (RP), his Special Education Needs counsellor connected him with SPD's Specialised Assistive Technology Centre where he was assessed for suitable devices, and received training in the use of the Proloquo4Text augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) system. The device allowed Joseph to better express himself as well as effectively conduct his presentations as part of his academic requirements. Joseph was also a guest panelist at our AAC Awareness Month webinar held last October!

Joseph has since graduated from RP and is now a Laboratory Technologist at Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory.

The Third Enabling Masterplan helps us build a caring and inclusive Singapore, where persons with disabilities like Joseph are empowered to be integral and contributing members of society. Read more about the Third Enabling Masterplan via our bio link today!

.
Plenty of research has documented manipulative misuses of emotional intelligence ‚Äî the intentionally subtle regulating of one‚Äôs emotions to engineer responses from others that might not be in their best interest. Given that most people aren‚Äôt sociopaths, this article argues, the more common misuses of emotional intelligence are subconscious. To safeguard against inadvertently falling prey to them, we need deeper levels of self-examination. Read the full article to learn three of the more common counterfeits seen that snare well-intended leaders.

It‚Äôs easier to attack or witness wrongdoing in another person than confront that possibility in one's own behavior.

Psychologically, it is crucial in our early development that we can distinguish another parent that is separate from our mothers. This duality allows us to form specific relations that we internalise as ways to understand ourselves and being with other people. Thus, no one can replace the crucial role a father plays in forming a paternal object that is sufficiently safe and gratifying in a child‚Äôs mind ‚Äî so that the child can tolerate being away from the secure confines of their mothers. In many instances big and small, it matters how our children experience their fathers and relations with men, including their attitudes toward their kids regardless of age. If you‚Äôre a Dad, it‚Äôs such a privilege to be able to play that role but we acknowledge, is one of the most important roles in your child‚Äôs life that will be deeply influencing for the rest of their lives. This is especially when we can exist in a context where sexist and toxic masculinity undertones are embraced. Happy Father‚Äôs Day to Dads everywhere!

Just typing those hashtags above, I‚Äôve discovered that there are over 340k posts for the former and 5k posts for the latter, which speaks about how relatively normal this term is. 

I‚Äôm not demanding that everyone should stop using these terms. All I‚Äôm asking is that we put a little more thought into the words we say to ourselves and to others. Do we really mean it?

Remember, we never know who is struggling with disordered thoughts towards food and eating. A joke could cause more harm than we ever intended for it to.

And to everyone reading this, 
It is okay to be fat. It is okay to have more fat than others. It is okay to eat what you want and not feel guilty and ashamed. It is okay to indulge without having to compensate or punish yourself for it. It is okay to be exactly you, in your body, doing what you desire.

Fat is not an insult or used to pass judgment. Fat is a descriptor, like tall, or short. Fat is not a feeling. Stop using fat to guilt or shame yourself or somebody else.

Today is a special day for us at 195PHC, as we bid farewell to a father figure who has kindly availed us his street-food skills and experience built up over many decades. Ah Pui's culinary contributions to our community as an individual are significant - satiating tummies, building our heritage, and inspiring others to soldier on amidst adversity.

In our fast-paced, hyperconnected society where achievements, success, and cash are often our kings, Ah Pui embodies an underdog story. A divorcee residing in public rental housing and a recipient of MSF ComCare assistance, Ah Pui is one of the 'invisibles' in Singapore. But despite circumstances, he remains resilient, and adamant in the pursuit of a better future.

At our core, 195PHC is a community F&B incubator - and in our time with Ah Pui, we have convinced him to 'go legal', think bigger, and embrace possibilities. Ah Pui has since found an independent angel investor who has already set up a company with him to take his satay offerings to the next level - and we eagerly await updates!

Two questions on everyone's minds: 

1) Whither the satay? Ah Pui has very kindly gifted the cafe with the full recipe for the satay and sauce, and has passed on the entirety of his skillsets to Ben - so it's business as usual for us as we continue churning out the sticks of indulgent delight!

2) Whither the cafe? Alongside our current F&B offerings which will remain unchanged, we will be bringing in new ones when Phase 2 (HA) concludes. These will continue to build on 195PHC's role as a community incubator.

Thank you Ah Pui - for your contributions, resolve, skills, and satay. While you will be missed dearly, we know The Best is Yet to Be.

Launched by M3@Jurong, Project S.H.E aims to support and provide assistance to young mothers and mothers-to-be. The committee hope that trained volunteers can not only link these mothers to the various agencies whenever they require assistance and also give them strength, hope and empowerment. 

We are extremely fortunate to live in Singapore where there are existing schemes and available help for these mothers and I got to know more about them through the sharing by staff from @msfcares and @viriya_community_services during the session too.

Attended the ‚ÄúYouth Work Day‚Äú event last Fri (7th May), which coincided with the international ‚ÄúThank a Youth Worker‚Äù day! 

In my opinion, Youth Work is often challenging, complex, and many a times, underrated. Yet, the importance of Youth Work cannot be overstated. Youth Workers are oftentimes the lone positive role model, or the only ray of light that young impressionable minds hang on to. 

Yet, rewards that the Youth Worker might savour sometimes do not bloom until years later‚Ä¶. and at times, not at all. Youth Work is a professional practice that requires a commitment, passion, and resilience. Thus, we need to do all that we can to support our Youth Workers. üí™

While we don‚Äôt always agree, our key to resolution is to always listen ‚Äî it may not happen instantly, especially when tempers flare, but deep in our hearts we know we want to work towards that goal and so on our own we‚Äôll find our way there. Once we‚Äôre calm, we can then have a proper conversation. 

For some couples, it can be hard to be objective and take a step back when tensions mount. That‚Äôs why the Ministry of Social and Family Development @msfcares has partnered with Community Psychology Hub (CPH) to provide online counselling service for those who may be facing marital and parenting stress. It‚Äôs completely free-of-charge and allows for anonymous sign ups. When we address issues early and identify the root cause, we prevent any emotions, that may be irrelevant to the original problem from escalating to a point where resolution becomes impossible.

What Sherry says about the role of social workers: ‚ÄúWe assess potential clients and allocate resources based on their needs, such as funding or referral to relevant professionals.

[MONTH 4] -- HOMELESSNESS

According to a study by CNA, about 1000 people live on the streets of Singapore. The homeless reportedly face health issues and dangers such as theft, and were often often approached and questioned by law enforcement agencies. Homelessness has been a serious and rising issue in Singapore for the past few years yet, are we doing enough for them?

The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) safe, sound sleeping places, run by 35 organisations that are existing or potential partners of the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (Peers) Network, was launched in July 2019. It mainly aims to help and take care of the homeless in Singapore by providing 700 spaces of safe shelters for them. Apart from providing shelters, a daily $15 food allowance is given and also, befrienders will continue to keep in touch with them through calls and texts. 

Should you see anyone in need of shelter, you can reach out to msf_peersoffice@msf.gov.sg or call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000.

A third of young adults here have self-harmed, with one in 10 doing so frequently, according to a survey released by international research agency YouGov.

It also found that a third of Singaporeans have experienced suicidal thoughts.

There are thoughts who hate, and they divide and they feed off people who don't fight back. Yeah we could laugh this off, but what about the person who can't? Whose gonna help? Silence only make them stronger.

#gridlife.online is participating in #THEORANGEEFFECT campaign because we all need a little help sometimes. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to talk about self-injury and mental health. Ask the questions everyone else is afraid to ask. Talk about it in a way that is accurate and respectful. Use car meet ups as a good opportunity to engage your peers. It is the best time as everyone is relaxed and enjoying their hobby which could be the one saving their lives from the everyday struggles.

We'll be louder than self-injury. Car enthusiasts and passion is more than just driving cars fast.

The past few years has been such an insane journey & one exciting surprise after another just pops up. I am an introvert & someone who HATES being in front of the camera. But I know in order to create change, you have to use the voice that you have no matter how small the audience & keep at it. If this resonates with you Be Bold, Stay Inspired & if you want to influence - Influence good & create positive impact.

Beside every woman is another woman supporting her. P. since Day 1 üòò because there are days when I just want to Curl up in a ball(yes I‚Äôll be a darn big ball), bawl my eyes out.  And then She says ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got this Az!‚Äù

Women make up the majority of the social service sector and continue to bear most caring responsibilities at home. With 2021 declared by @msfcares as the year of #CelebratingSGWomen, we want to recognise all women who have given their all both for their family and the wider society. 

Chrystella and Samantha are two out of many #LadiesWhoLead at HCSA. Chrystella wasn‚Äôt sure where her career path would lead, but it was during a mission trip to China when she felt called to pursue a Masters in Counselling. 

On the other hand, Samantha had made her mind up at a young age that she wanted to work in the social service sector. Even though their initial goals were worlds apart, their paths eventually converged. 

‚ÄúAlthough the social service industry is women-dominated, there are many ladies, like our beneficiaries, who are less privileged and not as fortunate to be able to choose. That‚Äôs why IWD matters to all of us,‚Äù said Samantha. 

‚ÄúI think International Women‚Äôs Day is about celebrating women and our unique contributions. More women are in the workforce now, and most of them are still family-oriented too. 

‚ÄúDRTC staff comprises mostly women and I value the relationships that we have. It spurs us to give our best in our work, for our beneficiaries. We even had to say: ‚ÄúGuys, we can't hang out so much due to COVID-19,‚Äô‚Äù Chrystella said. 

‚ÄúThe late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said that of his two concerns ‚Äì country and family ‚Äì he looked after the former while his wife cared for the latter. The impact of his wife's contribution really stuck with me,‚Äù Samantha added. 

To all #LadiesWhoLead both at work and at home, thank you for your contributions! üëè",,,Photo,MSF Singapore,msfcares,NVPC - Towards a City of Good,cityofgoodsg,,,,,2524602073993955557_8227003110,2022-03-22T12:45:16.298Z,https://www.instagram.com/msfcares,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am glad to support national effort to understand Singaporeans‚Äô aspirations and ideas on how we can further advance our women in Singapore.

Is heart-warming that we are celebrating our women's multi-faceted roles across society, and thanks for the men who help to debunk stereotypes, change mindsets and play an active role in supporting and uplifting women. 

Love this logo which inspired by Singapore's national flower, the Vanda Miss Joaquim.

The three silhouettes embedded in the orchid symbol represent the progress of women from the past to the present and into the future, while the spectrum of shades symbolise the diversity of women across generations and backgrounds.

We, as women (be it stay home or working) are doing our best to contribute ourselves to our homes, schools, workplaces and communities ‚Äì improving every aspect of our society. Not an easy journey! Especially for stay-home moms (no cpf, no bonus, no leave, least recognition and likely have to worry for financial and retirement if not able to rely on your loved ones) 

Let us gather together to develop a much caring environment and uplifting one another üíïüí™üèª

Adoption is a legal process that ceases the rights of birth parents in caring for a child, and transfers them to adoptive parents.

The MSF @msfcares is seeking to hear your views on eliminating unethical behaviour in the adoption sector, finding a good home for every child put up for adoption and breaking cycles of abuse and neglect.

Not only for the fact that she has brought me up and sacrificed a lot of her own needs for mine, but also how capable she is as an individual. 

She is successful at work (despite her denying it all the time), and is also great at managing our family‚Äôs businesses. She is always keeping a keen eye out for business ventures and giving us tips and advice, to take our business to the next level. I‚Äôve always had great admiration for her as she is able to juggle so many things on her plate every day, especially now that I‚Äôm older and have taken over the family business.

Women are now increasingly being featured in magazines or news publications, and I applaud their great achievements. I find it heartening that they are making waves even in industries that are believed to be male-dominated. It just shows how far we have progressed in our economy and society as a whole. But we have some way to go to educate the masses that the worth of each individual is not dependent on gender.

So let's look forward to greater progress for our women.

She was a guide at the travel agency I went with. During the trip, I had a slight fever and she was very concerned. But she's always been responsible at heart ‚Äì she even kept in touch with her groups after umrah.

She used to conduct courses on pilgrimages in the evenings. I‚Äôd pick her up and we‚Äôd go for dinner and talk about our future together. That was our version of dates. And I‚Äôm there for her when she needs me. Even when we were just friends, I'd offer to accompany her parents to their medical visits.

She says that I‚Äôm an easy-going guy, and that the past is the past. As husband and wife now, we have to care for each other and share things with each other. We don‚Äôt keep secrets. This is how we try to build a family.

I made a promise to my late mum that I would be a more responsible person. Back then, she asked, ‚ÄòWhat do you mean by that? You‚Äôve been alone all this while.‚Äô I told her that I wanted to settle down, and she questioned: ‚ÄòAre you sure you are capable of taking on that responsibility?‚Äô 

So I found a girl of my dreams and proved to others, and myself, that I could lead a better life. And I made my mum proud. My family is my pillar ‚Äì we performed umrah together in 2019. They got to know her better and encouraged me to settle down with her. I think it‚Äôs destiny.‚Äù ü•∞üíï

‚Å£
So I‚Äôm dedicating this post to a superwoman, my mother. She made me believe that women are capable of anything & have the power to run the world only because I grew up watching her possess  immense confidence and strong will!  I have seen my mother fight through all the odds. She never once gave up. Even when times were tough for us financially... she always found a way to provide us the best.  I remember my mother, waking up as early as 4am to head to work. She did odd jobs, just so she can lighten the financial situation at home. She would then come back home and still cook and take care of us .. no matter how tired she was.  Her job required her to be always on the move.. she would come back home with her feet aching. She would soak her legs in warm water for a little while and then she will get back up .. just to attend to us.  She is kind, gentle yet so determined to provide the best for her family. And that always inspires me,till today. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Thank you Amma for always being so selfless! For making me believe that we women are so special and gifted! ‚Å£
‚Å£
Over the years I have seen the role of women in our society amplify! We take on roles, we create our own destiny.. we run the show! LIKE A BOSS! Let‚Äôs continue to celebrate women. Supporting one another and lifting each other higher and higher! ‚Å£

I‚Äôve always admired Liane for many reasons. But perhaps the one that stands out the most is her strong sense of faith and trust even when things aren‚Äôt smooth sailing. Even when the odds weren‚Äôt in her favour. 

In her early primary school days, she struggled with stuttering and that made it hard for her to find her voice... And so she turned to the voice within. Through penning down her thoughts (and so beautifully so I may say), she found an avenue to express herself. 

While it‚Äôs a rough scene for novelists/journalists in Singapore, she found a middle ground in PR where she could still delve in writing but in a more commercial manner. On the sidelines, writing still remains an outlet for her to introspect and reflect on pinnacle moments in her life. With her archive growing, she indirectly prepares to share her work with the world someday.

But I guess what inspires me the most, is how she always comes back to writing. That flame that burns so brightly in spite it all, as something that keeps her grounded and more importantly, alive. 

And to that, I‚Äôd like to say, thank you for daring to dream and I can‚Äôt wait for the day your dream comes to fruition. x

My elder sis had to assume the responsibility of taking care of my younger sister and I, when she was only a few years older than us. 

Growing up, she often cooked for us, helped us with our homework, and did all the other household chores (while making sure we did our fair share of them too). 

Even now, when my parents are not able to celebrate Chinese New Year in Singapore together with us this year, she has been planning and finding ways to organise a virtual celebration all on her own, so that we can still feel connected to our parents at home, and bask in the festivities together as a family, no matter where we are. 

I can‚Äôt imagine what my life would be like without her. If I were in her position, I don‚Äôt think I would have known what to do. I can't thank her enough for looking after us all these years, and always being there for us, as our elder sister

She is very disciplined and driven, treating obstacles as stepping stones to success, and learning from setbacks. Until she achieves her goal, she never gives up. And then she celebrates the win and sets a new and bigger goal!

The woman figure whom I look up to.. my mom! ü•∞ 

My mom has always been someone who is there for others. One incident I remember vividly was when her close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer. She stood by her throughout, keeping her company, and running her day-to-day errands. Most importantly, she was a great pillar of emotional support, making it a point to let her friend know that she‚Äôll always be there to listen. She encouraged her to stay positive, and press on with her battle against cancer till the very end.

As the saying goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed, and my mum is truly someone I know I can always fall back on, even when the going gets tough. I was particularly inspired by this incident, as it also showed me that incredible things can happen, when women support each other.

As we celebrate SG Women this year, I hope we can all shift mindsets to foster a more inclusive society for both men and women. üôåüèª

At Crazycat, we aim to remind everyday women of their worth so they can shine. This move is definitely a significant step in enabling greater conversations that we hope will create an actual shift in mindsets surrounding gender roles and stereotypes within our society.

We're excited to participate and be a part of this! For all you Crazycats out there, use your voices, be bold and play an active role in realising this change üíØ

The conversations on Singapore's women's development is ongoing and you can join and indicate your interest via our #linkinbio! Let's continue to create a cycle of strength and confidence from one woman to another ‚ú®

In the 1930s, Janet was sold for $250 as a mui sui, or slave girl from China to Singapore, when she was only 8 years old. 

She eventually freed herself from child bondage by making her own escape, and was later taken into a girls' home. She then went on to receive education in a mission school, and later joined St Andrew's Mission Hospital as a nurse. 

During World War II, she was captured by the Japanese and made a ‚Äòcomfort woman‚Äô. Thankfully for her, she managed to escape once again, and returned to nursing at St Andrew's. 

Not long after, Janet became Singapore's first Asian hospital matron, and the first woman in Singapore to publish a book in English. 

I am awed by Janet‚Äôs grit and tenacity in overcoming the odds and rising above adversity to change the course of her life. To me, she is a true inspiration to many women (and men alike) of our future generations - nothing is impossible if one sets out to achieve it. 

This year, join me in celebrating SG Women and show appreciation for all the wonderful women in your life! üíô 

Let‚Äôs take part in the Conversations on Singapore Women‚Äôs Development at go.gov.sg/sgwomen, and build a better, more inclusive society.

She Who Is All Of Us 

A woman figure whom I look up to is definitely my mom. Apart from her work, she didn‚Äôt have anyone to help her with house chores, and had to raise my siblings and I all on her own. Yet, she never once complained about it. 

Now that I am a mother too, I can fully understand how difficult those days must have been for her, and I really admire and appreciate her for all that she has done for us. 

I feel very blessed to have her help me out with taking care of my kids now, as it allows me time to focus on my career. 

To me, all mothers, regardless of whether they work inside or outside the home, deserve to be given the recognition for their contributions to society. A salute to all moms!

This is an upcoming new scheme reported yesterday by @msfcares; introduced to help Singaporeans and permanent residents affected by the pandemic.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Monique Tugas, volunteering with DOT, mentioned that the grant will help many of those who are retrenched but finding a job is still a priority.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Any financial support is definitely helpful but she adds that the women in DOT community is looking more at stability. So although they are grateful for the money, the concern is after three months where will they be.‚†Ä

Which is why fostering is a remarkable way to make a big difference in a young person‚Äôs life. Becoming a foster parent means providing an alternative care arrangement for children who are below 18 years of age, who have been abused, neglected or abandoned.Even though it comes with challenges, it also provides immense intangible rewards and satisfaction, as I found out through my interviews with afoster parent and a Senior Foster Care Officer.

And I‚Äôm glad I did so because I cleared up some of my misconceptions about fostering in Singapore too! Head to cheekiemonkie.net for my article, or click link in my bio.

Talking about death can sometimes seem morbid or difficult especially in Asian cultures, but why not look at it from the angle of being prepared for any future medical crises and saving your family unnecessary distress at an already difficult time?

Chapter 1: Coalblooded is the first chapter of our brand new series ""CINEMPATHY IN MOTION"" where we aim to cover the emotional and mental experiences of people from different walks of life. 

Physical and drug abuse is the main content of ""Coalblooded"" where such issues are still prevalent in today times. In Singapore, as much as we have done a great job in clamping down on these, it still happens and sometimes, unknowingly. 

We believe physical and drug abuse are never one off but collated small, subtle and unknowing choices that resulted as such. 

Like allowing your partner to get away with disrespecting you with words, followed by physically pushing you, slapping you and eventually hurting you.üëä

Like allowing your peers to insist you on taking something ""fun"" like weed because everyone is doing it, followed by happy pills and eventually trying something worse. üíä

Sometimes, a call for help seems weak but to us, it is one of the most courageous thing to do. We applaud those who have gone through such times and even when it seems like there's no hope, they stand up and get out of the tunnel. And we hope the same for anyone going through the same thing. 

Help is available as long as you reach your hands out. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

We had an exciting panel discussion and great turn out of 60 people on a Friday night! A huge thank you to the panelists: Ang Lay Hoon from @sccfsc, Denise Low from @msfcares, Norlin Bte Mustafa and Miriam Michelle from the DOT community. Also very grateful @carrietancares, Founder of DOT, for being the special guest for this event. ‚†Ä

The resources can be split into 2 different types: free services and paid services.

Free services include hotlines and CHAT‚Äôs mental health check. Please note that these are for emergency help or mental health assessment, and ùóîùó•ùóò ùó°ùó¢ùóß counselling services! Paid services include counselling services and government mental healthcare. 

It‚Äôs unfortunate that many choose not to seek mental health treatment due to financial reasons. In creating this list, we hope to shine a light on resources that are more wallet-friendly.

I stand behind this quote by Minister @kshanmugam_ which he shared at the ‚ÄúConversations on Women Development‚Äù dialogue this morning. It was my great pleasure to join my Parliamentary colleagues @sun.xueling and @rahayumahzam ¬†in this virtual discussion on women-related issues in Singapore.

Today‚Äôs discussion marks the start of a series of engagements that MSF, with support from MCCY and MHA, will be organising to engage the public on women-related issues. I am heartened to hear from the personal experiences of Singaporeans, particularly our youth from different background and causes (i.e. CYGO Youth Advisory Group, Mendaki Club, NEBO, etc), their thoughts on women-related issues, and what more we can do as a society. Views and feedback gathered from these engagements will be presented as a White Paper in Parliament in 2021.

Xue Ling, Rahayu and I would like to hear more from you ‚Äì women and men alike ‚Äì on this matter. Your feedback can help to shape programmes, policies, and legislation in Singapore to better support and uplift women. We are at the cusp of positive change, and I encourage you to partner with us in our efforts to create a better society for all.¬†

‚Ä¢ The acronym 'T' and 'U' (which represents the theme, Tranquility in Unity) are translated stylishly into an Islamic-looking logo through Jawi writing which is basic Muslim calligraphy.

‚Ä¢ The two dots in the logo symbolically represent the partnership between a man and his wife in achieving the theme (Tranquility in Unity) together .

‚Ä¢ The blending of blue and green projects natural harmony that is achieved within an analogous colour scheme.

While painting this, I thought of how oftentimes, the shroud of darkness we may be trapped in could mean that those around us who are well-intentioned or genuinely wanting to extend empathy and a listening ear cannot reach (into) us at all.  The loud inner (or monsters') voices  drown the distant sounds out and sometimes nothing helps. There are moments where we get tired of fighting the voices, and those are the times we really feel like giving up. Yet we have been brave before, and we are brave now. As we find ourselves passing through a next second, minute, hour, dawn, dusk...It's another little victory to celebrate üí™üèª hooray. We will begin again. One day at a time.

My team mate at @gushcloudsg challenged me this week to take an artistic approach towards this election and how I would draw some candidates that has impressed something onto me as an artist. 

So... The Singapore General Elections are upon us this week. Political parties are stating their motion and intent to be chosen as the voice of the people and bring us to a better future. This will be a series of candidates I feel are notable figures in this #ge2020. And the best way to do it, HYPEBEAST STYLE! 

First of the series for me is @desmond.lee . He's a strong advocate of the arts, mental wellness, sustainability and climate change. 1 million trees in the next 10 years sounds like an arduous feat but putting it in motion will definitely make the world a better place. 

Next... @hengsweekeat . Am coming for you and the East Coast Plan! :)

Join @thebodyshopsg, as they‚Äôre working with @nomoreorg @msfcares, to amplify their advice on how to help if you‚Äôre worried about someone and want to help combat the rise in domestic violence.
- If you feel someone is at risk of domestic violence, follow your instinct and offer help.
- If you see or hear an abusive situation, try figure out how to intervene safely. If the situation seems dangerous, don‚Äôt handle it yourself, get help from 999 or SMS the Police at 71999 immediately.
- If a friend confides in you, create a code word or sign so you know when help is needed.
- While supporting, help them develop a plan to stay safe, including where to go, items to take and emergency numbers like 999.
- Learn about domestic violence. Abuse isn‚Äôt always physical. Verbal and emotional abuse is still domestic violence.
- Help prevent domestic violence by speaking to your children and teaching them about healthy, respectful relationships.

It has taken a long time, but after a lot of work, many brave people have come out to share their stories.

It is important for us as a community to hear their voices and validate their experiences. It is important for us to hold predators accountable for the injustice that they have done. And it is just as important for us to know where we can refer our friends and family to when they call out for help.
+
I hope that even if you have never been a victim, you can familiarise yourself with some of these resources, so that if anyone approaches you for help, especially during this time, you know where they can go to seek professional help.
+
If you are a victim, then you are incredibly strong. But please know that you don't have to be strong alone. You can share your burdens. There are people who will believe you and hear you out. There is a chance for things to get better for you. Good luck.

- Delivery of groceries and fresh food during this transitory period
- EZ Link card top-ups for essential workers to retain their jobs and for those required to go for job interviews to secure new employment.

It is practiced and adhered to by parents and children alike when dropping off at, or fetching from the centre.‚Å£
‚Å£
There are aplenty visuals and signs to help us with this and Bray demonstrates in the cover pic. He was so excited to return to school, in a mask no less! Within the centre, many similar signs were also put up to remind the children to do their part. This I'm assured of as the Centre Principal and his teachers had already briefed us ahead the previous Friday via a private zoom session with us parents before school even started. Also, My First Skool even developed a back-to-school kit with lots of tips and activities for transiting from home back to schools! We highly recommend that you read it with your child too! (Go to https://bit.ly/mfs-back-to-school-kit #linkinbio!)‚Å£
‚Å£
I especially want to thank how My First Skool supported us in preparing Bray for back-to-school. I mean, sure, we can do endless activities revolving around covid-19 (also part of his home based learning), but nothing beats a special tea time his teachers organised in the week before school reopened.‚Å£
‚Å£
They put on their uniform, login zoom at the designated timing, smashed up some eggs together, made themselves sandwiches and milk, and chanted their same before-meal cheer which they always do together in school!‚Å£
‚Å£
For the children, it was an awesome catch up with each other over their self-made tea snacks. For me as I saw it, it was a seamless simulation of how school has always been - their patient teachers guiding them through their hands-on activities together, and the camaraderie in class that has always been there. What better way to make them look forward to go back to school!‚Å£
‚Å£
Registrations are now open till June 2021*! Sign up with NTUC First Campus‚Äô My First Skool today to experience their quality and holistic education! #linkinbio‚Å£ (https://bit.ly/belanbray-mfsbacktoschool)

Most people see working from home as a positive, that you get to spend more time with your partner, the first person you see in the morning, the last person at night and also everything in between. Considering most of us don‚Äôt live in a mansion where you get your own personal space; a darker and less talked about side of couple quarantine is how the time spent together also gives rise to the potential risk of conflict. With varying styles in handling different situations, daily small annoyance can quickly escalate to a full blown war. We all need to understand that we are all strangers in these unprecedented times. With the added pressure of work uncertainties and the inability to head out to do what we want, we are all feeling it regardless if we put it out there anot. It‚Äôs also in these times that we all need to learn to be a little bit more patient to the people around. Let the situation draw us closer rather than pull us apart. Let us all learn to be abit more giving and understanding towards each other - for as a couple, it‚Äôs never you against them, it‚Äôs always going to be you against the world. Learn to let the little things go for it‚Äôs the bigger picture of being together that‚Äôs truly worth fighting for. Stay hopeful, stay strong and when we all pull through this together, this period would be one of the stories we tell our kids for the ages.

‚Å£
======================================‚Å£
‚Å£
During this period where families are staying home and spending more time with one another, relationships can be strained and there is a possibility that frictions may occur if there are underlying tensions or new anxieties and concerns to arise.‚Å£
‚Å£
@msfcares Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has worked with the #CommunityPsychologyHub to provide online counselling at¬†www.cphonlinecounselling.sg.¬†This FREE service supports people with marital, divorce or parenting issues. Anyone who is feeling stressed or anxious are encouraged to step forward and seek help early by talking to the counsellors at CPH Online Counselling via live chat or email.‚Å£
‚Å£
Apart from the CPH Online Counselling service, there is also the #NationalCAREHotlineSg at 1800-202-6868 alongside other community helplines offering mental wellness and marital parenting and counselling support.‚Å£
‚Å£
Seeking help early is important, along with supporting each other so that we can overcome the crisis and strengthen our family life.¬†#‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å£
‚Å£
‚Å£
P.S. #Enacted pics; no mama nor child was harmed in the process of these pic taking. All hair and face features remain intact. Both mama and child were laughing hysterically while reviewing their takes. Son gave away and broke into a smile by the third pic - did you notice? üòÜ‚Å£
‚Å£
P.S.S. It's ok not to be ok. ‚Å£
Sometimes, we just need to wind down and chill. Sometimes, we just need to slow down. Sometimes, if all fails, it's ok to ask for help. ‚Å£
Stay safe, stay well, stay sane üíïüôå‚Å£

Family is something we take for granted, but these two individuals remind us of it's importance.
.
We were privileged to invite both beneficiaries to give their testimonies at last year's Night of Hope Gala; and in light of International Day of Families today, we wanted to share them again with you!
.
(L) Natasha is an alumni of HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre. Growing up, she went through episodes of abuse, depression and anxiety. This led to her to attempt suicide twice. But things started to change after she came to Dayspring and learned what it felt like to be accepted and heard.
.
(R) Feroz is an alumni of HCSA Highpoint Halfway House. As a husband and father, he felt helpless in prison when he and his wife got divorced and his children were far away. He was determined to get back to his family after his release and with Highpoint's support, he did. He now looks forward to go back to family at the end of each day.

The only ‚Äútoy‚Äù I played with was my paper doll which my Mom made for me. She taught me how to draw and make a few pieces of clothing for the paper doll but I bet she didn‚Äôt expect that I ended up making hundreds of outfits. Probably that was an early sign of my affinity with fashion illustration.
.

It was one of my fondest memories of my childhood and my time spent with my Mom.  So when the Ministry of Social and Family Development @msfcares asked if I can help to create some art activities that can help families bond together as we all stay home in our fight against Covid-19, I just knew that making paper dolls would be one of them. So here‚Äôs a video showing you how you can make your very own paper doll. 
To download my paper doll template, go to the link in my bio above.

If you love fashion and perhaps dreamt of being a fashion designer or stylist, you would love this. Stay home, stay creative!‚ù§Ô∏è .

Isolation, social distancing and extreme changes in daily life are hard now, but Singapore also needs to be prepared for what may be an epidemic of clinical depression because of COVID-19.

We do not wish to be the bearers of bad news. But this crisis, and our response to it, will have psychological consequences. 
Individuals, families and communities need to do what they can to support the mental health of everyone around us.

Most of us know the emotional attributes of depression: sadness, irritability, emptiness and exhaustion. 
Given certain conditions, these universal experiences influence our mind and transform it, reducing  motivation and disrupting sleep, appetite and attention. 
Depression lays waste to our capacity to problem-solve, set and achieve goals and function effectively.

What can we do ? It‚Äôs time to take ACTion.

But with care-giving duties on their plate, this wasn't always the case. In fact, both mothers faced difficulties in finding suitable job opportunities to earn an income.

We started seeking out work and training opportunities that they could benefit from, and empowered them with the confidence and skills to realise their potentials. Kartigah was linked up with E&S Blessing's Celebrating Dreams mentoring initiative (@esblessingbox), while Yuni started on a training programme with Bettr Barista (@bettrbarista).

I was clueless on how to move on as a single mother of two young kids.
.
At first, I didn't have much confidence in myself and I was concerned about caregiving arrangements should I start working on a regular basis. But my neighbour introduced me to SPIN and things changed.
.
Jeanne (my social worker) and Yani (my ally volunteer) from SPIN believed in my potential and constantly encouraged me to try something new, take up a course, or learn a skill. They even took the next step to provide me with available options and discussed job/training opportunities that I could benefit from.
.
With their support, I am currently pursuing a Holistic Training Programme with Bettr Barista (@bettrbarista @bettr.group) that will help kickstart my career in the Speciality Coffee Industry. I‚Äôm thankful to Jeanne and Yani for the amount of encouragement, time and effort they have put in to open doors like this for me - even preparing me for my interview with them.
.
They believed in me even when I didn‚Äôt believe in myself and because of that, I was able to take a step of faith to pursue this programme to become a barista. SPIN has played a big part in helping me reach where I am today ‚Äì full of hope and purpose in my life.
.
My hope is to find a stable job that will allow me to be financially independent so that I can afford a place of my own where I can support, provide for, and raise my two children.‚Äù - Yuni

.
I was given the opportunity to attend workshops and empowerment sessions such as leather crafting and CV writing. In fact, I've regularly attended almost all of these sessions organised by SPIN. They made me feel more empowered to provide for my children because I was learning new things that could help me better myself, find a job or earn some money.
.
My goal is to be free from financial difficulties and spend more time with my kids as they grow up. I wish for my kids good health, and hope that they develop a heart of kindness especially to those in need - just like the kindness SPIN staff and volunteers have shown to us."" - Wahida

The effectiveness of a military and its budget is NOT in how many bullets/missiles we fire at our enemies or how many battles our soldiers fight in. It is rather the OPPOSITE. The military‚Äôs true effectiveness is in the battles it DOES NOT have to fight (i.e. the lives it DOES NOT have to sacrifice to war) and the bullets/missiles it DOES NOT have to fire. If our military doesn‚Äôt have targets to shoot at, that is mission success. Because it means no enemies dare cross us, and we may enjoy a modicum of peace. It‚Äôs called Deterrence.

It‚Äôs a peace and stability that we as a people, even the folks at TOC, get to take for granted. Today, we don‚Äôt have to shoot anyone, and we should be thankful for it.

ùó¢ùóª ùó™ùóµùó≤ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóø ùó™ùó≤ ùó°ùó≤ùó≤ùó± ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóô-ùüØùü±ùòÄ
Now, part of maintaining the security status quo is making sure that we change along with the times. Our F-16s are ageing and the F-35s are replacements for a key pillar of our military defence. They‚Äôre expensive, but absolutely necessary. 
It took more than 10 years for the RSAF and DSTA for their time and expertise to make such evaluation and we say, trust them to do their job.

ùó¢ùóª ùó¶ùóºùó∞ùó∂ùóÆùóπ ùó¶ùóΩùó≤ùóªùó±ùó∂ùóªùó¥
Before anyone tries to suggest, ‚ÄúDoes that mean that the military budget should grow indefinitely?‚Äù, we‚Äôre going to stop you here. It‚Äôs easy to start thinking that our Ministers make arbitrary decisions about the budget. 
But the ministries are staffed by Singaporeans too - they may be your parents, neighbours, relatives, or maybe even your children who've graduated university already. Trust them to do their job right and calibrate our budget right. After all, we‚Äôre not only paying the ministers to do so, we‚Äôre paying the entire civil sector too.

ùóßùóü;ùóóùó•
Our military spending keeps us safe and allows us to go about our way of life. Don‚Äôt cut it anyhow. Trust people to do their jobs right.

I have been their sole caregiver since.
.
Growing up, my own mother left the family and my father remarried. So I struggled with the fact that my children may grow up in a ""similar"" situation as me.
.
I had to readjust my life after my wife‚Äôs death such as rearranging my regular priorities to deal with practical concerns. I now have a helper to assist with my children and divide the chores such as cooking, cleaning and getting groceries.
.
One thing that could have prepared me for fatherhood is knowing how to handle kids like how mothers can. As a single father, it is a struggle to know how to be a father and mother at the same time.
.
I still remember how my older son, then four years old, asked why his mother wasn‚Äôt with us on Mothers' Day. The loss still feels apparent especially when I think about how my wife will no longer be able to watch our sons get married.
.
HCSA Dayspring SPIN reached out to me when my wife‚Äôs accident came out in the news. SPIN offered me social support by matching me with a volunteer befriender. This was helpful because being a widower is often not talked about in Singapore ‚Äì it‚Äôs a topic people find hard to broach.
.
SPIN supported me in my parenting journey, even though it‚Äôs still something I struggle with at times especially when it comes to the kind of gentleness needed in handling my sons.‚Äù - Ronald

KARTIGAH, SINGLE MOTHER OF 5'.",2020-01-04T04:00:38.000Z,"""My focus has always been raising my kids - a set of triplets and two older kids. But with no support from their father, it was very difficult!
.
Having two young kids with special needs, I had to quit my job as a food stall helper to stay home and take care of the one who was unable to get into student care. Managing a big family like mine made it hard to find time to do anything else, much less go out to work.
.
My work options are limited especially due to the lack of caregiving support I receive for my triplets, so I have been sourcing for home-based work that is tailored to my sewing skills. SPIN linked me up with a social enterprise called E&S Blessing‚Äã that guided me in starting a small home-based business to supplement my family's income. I was the first on board their Celebrating Dreams mentoring initiative that aims to support single mothers, like myself, by providing us a platform to tap on our skills.
.
As going out to find a job is a big difficulty for me, opportunities like this have been so helpful because they enable me to earn some money while being assured that my children are well taken care off. I'm hoping to improve my sewing skills and will definitely go for classes if they're available!
.
With SPIN‚Äôs assistance and support, I have been empowered to make small changes to improve my situation. It is not easy, but I will try my best because I like being a mom. On one part, it‚Äôs okay and fun. On the other, it is also very stressful. But when my children are happy and I see them happy, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm happy ‚Äì and that is what makes everything okay.‚Äù

LAYLA, SINGLE MOTHER OF 1'.",2019-12-28T04:00:27.000Z,"‚ÄúWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was afraid to have my baby because of the abuse I was facing by my own mother at home. At that time, I had nobody to talk to about this, neither did I have any newborn items to prepare for my baby's arrival.
.
I was referred to SPIN when I was 4 months pregnant and they journeyed with me until my delivery. I was blessed with baby clothes, maternity clothes, and other items that I didn't even know I would need.
.
They continued to support me even after I gave birth. When a SPIN volunteer found out I had no cupboard to store my baby's clothes, she pooled her resources to get me brand-new plastic drawers to keep the clothes neatly. It was also through SPIN that I learned how to raise my newborn daughter with the help of a child nurse volunteer and lactation consultant. Without them, I would still be unable to feed my daughter because of her lip and tongue ties.
.
In my time with SPIN, I've attended several empowerment sessions that allowed me to open up and learn from fellow mothers who have gone through similar situations as me. These sessions have taught me practical skills such as solids-making tips, and have also inspired me to make steps towards pursuing my dreams through activities such as vision-boarding. I'm grateful to the volunteers who help watch our children so that we, parents, can make the most of these inspiring workshops.
.
My daughter is now my priority. Even if I have to forgo my income for days, I will keep her at home when she is sick so she can rest properly. I want to create a hygienic, safe and conducive home environment for her, make sure she has clean clothes to wear, clean bedsheets to sleep on, and clean toys to play with. I am also learning to cook nutritious meals for her."" - Layla

So, I never really knew what a mother should be like.
.
At first, I was having post-natal blues and it was difficult to deal with my emotions especially being alone with two ""new-born"" kids. I never understood what true support felt like and I didn't quite trust the SPIN counsellors and volunteers at the start. But I was so wrong.
.
SPIN provided me with a strong support system through my volunteers, Jyostna and Kirsty, who have been extremely supportive of me and regularly check to see how I'm doing. They were the ones who made strive to be a better person and a good mom to my kids.
.
With SPIN‚Äôs fresh food programme, I was able to prepare home-cooked meals for my daughters which brought me a lot of joy. I also actively attend SPIN‚Äôs events and workshops as they provide a good platform for me to meet other moms like myself, learn more about being a good mother and also let my daughters enjoy activities I would otherwise not be able to bring them for.
.
Now that I am a mother myself, I am trying my best to be independent and self-reliant, working hard to upgrade myself. I'm thankful for the close relationship I have with both my daughters and I always tell them to never give up. Both of them mean a lot to me and I hope to be a responsible mother who shows them great care and affection."" - Nayli

.
We separated after he introduced me to illegal substances and had an affair. Even after, he would demand sexual favours in exchange for monthly maintenance of our four children.
.
In the darkest moment of my life - unemployed, penniless and homeless - I spent nights in public areas and tried taking my own life with sleeping pills and a razor. I was incarcerated for possession and consumption of illegal substances. But things took a turn for the better upon my release when I was introduced to SPIN.
.
For the first time in my life, I felt genuine happiness. With SPIN's empathy and support, I learned how to be brave at my lowest points and even found a job to support my family.
.
I started to appreciate the beauty around me and would like to encourage others to do the same: each failure is not an obstacle but a stepping stone, each piece of advice is not an insult but a guide to better yourself."" - Eva

Self-harm and alcohol became my way of coping with my emotions. Not long after, I attempted suicide and became unsafe to myself. This was when I was sent to Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre.
.
The place became a strong pillar of support in my recovery. It was there where I learned more about myself and started to feel better about my life. Instead of harming and intoxicating myself, I found healthier ways to cope with my stress and sadness. Slowly, I traded away my negative and harmful thoughts, and filled myself with positive ones instead. This helped me concentrate in my studies.""

Some of you may have seen a recent post where someone snapped photos of an elderly man sleeping at Bukit Merah View Hawker Centre. We want to share with you the story of Mr Tan, and the many helping hands in Henderson Dawson who have been helping him since 2004. 
Mr Tan was found sleeping below the CTE by a good samaritan in 2004, and was referred to our Bukit Merah View Thong Kheng Seniors Activity Centre programme coordinator Mr Anthony Teo for help. Since then, HDB has provided a rental unit to Mr Tan at Henderson Heights, and he is also receiving financial assistance as well as free meals provided by Thong Kheng. 
Mr Tan does not have relatives here, and it‚Äôs Mr Anthony Teo who has been helping Mr Tan with all necessary procedures and visiting him whenever Mr Tan had to be admitted to the hospital. 
Mr Tan is not homeless as the post alleged. There are nights when Mr Tan chooses to sleep at the market when it‚Äôs cooler and quieter, but he does have a home to go back to. We local VWOs and community partners will of course continue to ensure that Mr Tan gets the help that he needs, as we love and respect our elderly in Henderson Dawson a lot.

Since then, my social worker has always been there to listen to my problems and advise me when I have no one to turn to.

Through SPIN's outings and empowerment workshops, I started to widen my social support circle by meeting with volunteers and other single parents like myself. My children were able to experience things I could never have afforded.

The counseling sessions also helped me become a better parent who can manage my finances and plan for my future. I am very appreciative of  how SPIN has shaped me into the person I am today.""

On Wednesday, over 400 future and current early childhood educators received the ECDA Scholarships and Training Awards that will support them in their career aspirations in the sector. We will support these educators at every stage of their journey to deepen their professional knowledge and ensure a fulfilling career. Many educators I met told me how their families, friends and colleagues are sources of inspiration and motivation for them to become the best teachers they can be. 
All of us play a part in giving every child a good start. Let us continue to empower our early childhood educators and help them succeed!

""I felt so alone and afraid because I didn't know what to do, where to go to, or who to look to for support. I knew being a single mom would not be easy and I was fearful because society still finds it hard to accept single parents like us.
.
But joining SPIN helped me to realise that I am not as alone as I once thought I was. In fact, the volunteers and social workers showed me that I was never alone in this journey by offering to help me wholeheartedly should I ever needed help.
.
SPIN even went to the extent of helping me with diapers, milk powder and other necessities for my child, which I am more than grateful for!
.
Being a part of SPIN was a huge comfort for me because I now had a platform to turn to and a community of single parents like myself. It was great getting to interact with other mums because we could relate to each other, share our experiences and encourage one another.
.
I have to admit that it's still not easy to be a single mom, but at least I don't feel alone and I know that SPIN will be there to support me into becoming a good mom.""

.
‚ÄúI battled with issues such as smoking, drinking and cutting for many years. They were big hurdles that prevented me from getting better, hurdles that I couldn‚Äôt overcome.
.
Cutting, especially, was the biggest habit I couldn‚Äôt stop. I would cut myself when I was angry and depressed. I felt worthless and helpless, like I was never good enough - and the cycle of cutting repeated. As a result, I was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health several times.
.
Soon after, my caseworker decided that it would be best for me to come to Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre. Dayspring helped me to boost my self-esteem by teaching me proper values and skills to manage my emotions. I started to accept myself more.
.
I am a very different person today as compared to the day I first stepped into Dayspring. Now, I no longer harm myself and my family relationships have been very good.
.
My passion is to help people and I hope that my experience at Dayspring and my story can motivate and inspire others that are going through a similar situation as me.‚Äù

Penny* knew that feeling all too well. Here's her story.
.
‚ÄúI always doubted whether I was important to my family because I was either beaten, abused or chase out of my house. No one ever fought for me, only with me.
.
Having two dads, I never knew who my biological father was. But it didn‚Äôt matter because I was abused by him anyway ‚Äì beaten, scolded and forced into doing chores. Even my mum couldn‚Äôt help me because my dad would beat her too.
.
There were even times when my mum was the one who chased me out when we argued or when she was drunk. Running away from home became the new normal. My mum had to file a missing person report multiple times.
.
Even when my family problems subsided, I would still runaway because my friends showed me more love than my family ever did. I felt more comfortable being out than at home. But my friends landed me on the wrong path of smoking, drinking and other bad things.
.
Even though I tried to change for the better, my past still affected me and my family problems still persisted ‚Äì so I just went back to how I used to be. Soon, I was sent to Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre because I stopped attending school and constantly ran away from home.
.
Being at Dayspring has helped me learn how to cope with my family problems. The staff also guided me through my trust issues and helped to build my self-esteem. I hope that my family will be able to live happily with each other and not fight as much anymore ‚Äì neither do I want to be chased away by my mum again.‚Äù

I was taught proper coping methods of how to regulate my emotions and soon started to develop a healthy view of myself. I also became more aware of my actions, and how they might affect others in return.
.
Knowing that there were people who cared enough about me and wanted to journey alongside with me was the biggest encouragement. Their support encouraged me to attain a vocational training institution to fulfill my dream of becoming a professional make-up artist one day.""

Helping more young people see that raising a family is Achievable, Enjoyable and Celebrated ‚Äì this is what we, as a society, can collectively do to make Singapore a Great Place for Families. 
Yesterday, @desmond.lee, @dramykhor, and I visited one of My First Skool‚Äôs newest preschools @Punggol. Always a joy to be among kids. 
We shared more details on some of the areas that PM @leehsienloong had spoken about at #NDR2019. Healthcare, preschool, and housing are concerns that shape the decisions of many young Singaporeans, who are considering marriage, and starting their family. We will further support Singaporeans in three key areas: 
1)Making quality preschool more affordable and accessible for families

2)Extending support to first-time home buyers. @lawrencewongst will share more next month.

3)Providing more healthcare support for couples and children 
More details on the enhancements can be found at https://www.heybaby.sg. 
Many Singaporeans want to have meaningful family lives, while establishing fulfilling careers. Workplace cultures and norms need to become more supportive of family life. But this is a cultural issue that Government policies alone cannot address. To improve work-life harmony in Singapore, we need to tackle the issues together. Next month, the Citizens‚Äô Panel on Work-Life Harmony will look into ways to create more family-friendly workplaces. 
I hope parents take the enhancements in Government support in the right spirit. In some countries, the parents pocket the savings and re-direct their efforts to spending quality time with their children. Lighten your burden, and make raising children more enjoyable. 
Let us all help one another to keep parenting enjoyable. It‚Äôs not a race against one another, but a journey of joy and love we can all take together.

Here's his story.
.
‚ÄúI spent half my age in and out of prison for drug-related offences. It was after NS that I had my first taste of drugs out of curiosity, but things started to collapse when I got introduced to heroin. I kept thinking to myself: I can quit any time. Little did I know that I would only keep tumbling.
.
During my incarceration, I constantly gave false hope to my family ‚Äì each time claiming that it would be ‚Äúthe last‚Äù. I even wrote them letters. But despite all of this, I would always fall back down again. It was only after my last release that I made a resolution to myself and my family that this was truly the last time.
.
Even though I was the black sheep of my family, my mother and brother would always come to visit me. But there was a time when my mum didn‚Äôt visit for 3 months. Puzzled, I later found that she was ill and bedridden. This made me very anxious about my release so I could visit her. Thankfully, I managed to see her upon my release and spend the last 3 years of her life by her side.
.
Being a reserved individual, I always kept to myself and didn‚Äôt really like to mix around a lot. After coming to Highpoint, I started to open up my mind to what‚Äôs good for me ‚Äì which is socialising with people. Now, I look forward to exposing myself to new people and experiences. I want to see more to my life than just ‚Äòme‚Äô and ‚Äòdrugs‚Äô. After all, a colourful life doesn‚Äôt need to come from drugs. There are so many other ways to feel that ‚Äòhigh‚Äô, you can dance, play soccer, but drugs is not the thing.
.
I‚Äôve been sober for the past 4 years. Until now, I haven‚Äôt had the slightest chance to see what drugs look like ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt intend to either. It is unfortunate that my mum can‚Äôt see where I am now, but I am sure she will be proud of me from where she is.‚Äù

""As a single mother, there are still times that I experience loneliness in my parenting journey and get little respite from the daily care-giving of Jovan. Despite having a small group of close friends I seek emotional support from, there are many practical areas in which they are unable to help me with.

But at the end of the day, what I appreciate the most is watching Jovan grow up like any other kid in an ‚Äòintact‚Äô family.
.
I am happy to see that he‚Äôs not losing out, and in certain cases I think he is very blessed because my love for him is more than sufficient.
.
I cherish the moments when Jovan kisses and hugs me, and tells me that he loves me the most in the world - ‚ÄúI love you the most mama and I know you take care of me whenever I‚Äôm sick‚Äù. These are things he says that may not mean that much to him, but I would do it all over again just for him.‚Äù

Here's her story.
.
‚ÄúNever once did I expect to be abused by my own family. I was sexually abused by my grandfather and three cousins, while my aunties often verbally abused me by calling me names. The name-calling continued in school where I was bullied for my size and skin-colour.
.
I needed a way to numb the pain so I began cutting myself ‚Äì first out of curiosity, and then as an addiction. Cutting became my drug, to the point where I would cut myself every day after school. It was a form of self-punishment for anything that happened in life, even if it was something small.
.
Honestly, I didn‚Äôt see a reason to continue living and attempted my first suicide in 2014. This landed me in a children‚Äôs home where I attempted suicide again. This time, I took enough drugs to feel the pain, but not enough to die.
.
I was sent to a safer place ‚Äì HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre. DRTC helped me to cope with my past and my depression. I mean, no one can cure my illness, but there are people who can help me to help myself. And that was what DRTC did for me.
.
They helped me find my voice, when I thought I had lost it forever; they started me on the journey towards freedom.‚Äù

But she soon learned that it didn't have to be that way.
.
""Before I joined SPIN, my life was all sorts of stress. I found it extremely difficult to cope with my son - especially as a single mum. But SPIN showed me that I wasn't alone, by giving single mothers like myself a platform to share about our struggles and learn how to cope with them.
.
I'm thankful for the many outings that my son and I could participate in, and for all the advice that the SPIN family has given me. Not only did they help me feel less alone, they have also motivated me to strive hard to provide for my family. My hope is for my son to be a good boy and learn how to be independent.

SPIN has really changed our lives for the better, and I am deeply appreciative of everything they have done!""

.
""My parents were never around when I was young and I grew up often feeling abandoned, never having experienced family warmth and love. I was placed in foster care and I often struggled with managing my feelings and emotions.
.
To me, Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre (DRTC) was a safe environment for me to discover my strengths and learned skills on how to regulate my feelings. I learned that there are people who care a lot about me, and I started reciprocating the love to others as well. As I did so, I began to find a sense of belonging.
.
I have now moved into a new foster family who have been very welcoming to me. They have showered me with the warmth and love that I previously lacked but always longed for.""

.
""At a very young age, I was placed in foster care and spent my early childhood years enduring traumatic experiences. Because of these experiences, I grew up filled with anger and I constantly felt like I could never trust anyone in my life. Whenever I was upset, I would lash out and hit the people who tried to show me care.
.
But things changed when I came to HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre (DRTC). I started to feel safe and accepted by staff who persistently showed me care and support. They helped me recognise how my past had such a big impact on how I reacted to people in different situations.
.
Now, I am learning to regulate my emotions and discover more about myself. As I do so, it has helped me to build deeper relationships and live peacefully with others around me. My hope is move back home and be with my family some day.""

Here's what a volunteer with our single parents at HCSA Dayspring SPIN thinks!‚ò∫Ô∏è
.
""In my five years of managing and building a parenting community online, I have witnessed this not a just a few but many times. Yes, the community of friends and even strangers who have common goals can help and at times better than relatives.
.
My online parenting community online, BabyChakra‚Äã, sees this happen every single day. Mothers and Fathers login to the App and discuss their parenting issues. Some have even become very good friends.
.
It may not be as easy when meeting face to face. You may wonder ‚ÄúWhat do I talk about?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow and why will a stranger help?‚Äù These are common hesitations. But just stop and think. The people in the community, SPIN, have many things in common. They understand your concerns and challenges as a single parent. They are more likely to show empathy and care for you. They may just have some advice that can help you.
.
Even if you are not looking for advice, being a part of a meaningful group of friends who help each other is a great feeling in itself. The sense of belonging fills you up with an unbeatable courage and confidence.
.
Take it slow if you like. Your comfort is most important. You may start off with a casual meeting and just introduce yourself. Share with the group what you like to do. Take small steps to participate and interact with other single parents at SPIN. All it takes is a few small steps to being a confident person and parent. SPIN is here for you.""

Here's her story.
.
""For a long time, stress was the only thing I felt about my family situation. But now, I can finally feel happy! I am thankful for what SPIN has done for me and I feel at home with the friendly volunteers and staff. They have offered me so much help - food rations and even outings for my children. It brings me much joy just being able to bring the kids out!
.
I also feel empowered to provide for my kids after attending workshops such as crafting and CV writing. My goal is to be free from financial difficulties and spend more time with my children. My greatest wish is for my children to have good health and develop a heart of kindness.""

When I first came to Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre (DRTC), I was untrusting of adults and felt like running away. But eventually during my stay, I started to make a lot of new friends and slowly adopted new ways of regulating and coping with my emotions in a healthier way.

""All my divorces had a recurring pattern - they were always about criminal and drug related issues. In fact, I used to be a drug addict and an offender myself. With my past and my bankruptcy status, it was almost impossible to find a job.I desperately needed one as I had no family support.

Since I joined SPIN, my children and I have experienced so much smiles and laughter. I could never afford to fulfill my children‚Äôs dreams, but SPIN changed that for me! They provided us with food rations, furniture and toys, and even organised many fun outings. More importantly, SPIN supported me in gaining financial independence by arranging a job interview with a partner corporate organisation. They helped me establish a stable routine of work and care-giving to best support my family.
.
Through events and SPIN empowerment sessions, I started to widen my social support circle by meeting with volunteers and other SPIN members like myself. I am very appreciative of the help and joy that SPIN gave me in becoming a responsible mother who has clear goals and stable employment. Because of that, I have now decided to become an ally volunteer to help other members in need.""

Here's the story of how she found a place to call home.
.
""Being the only child in my family with no close relatives, I had never experienced what family warmth and love felt like. I was even labelled as an aggressive child in my previous placements when all I ever really wanted was to have a family.
.
I was referred to HCSA Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre (DRTC) in 2017 after undergoing several placements. During my stay in DRTC, I tried very hard to fit in and to be accepted. I couldn‚Äôt regulate my emotions and often had difficulties in managing my feelings. It took me a while, but I was soon able to build rapport with the other girls and staff. I realised I didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äòtry to fit in‚Äô, I just needed to see myself as who I was.
.
In the safe environment of DRTC, I learned how to rationalise my feelings, discovered my strengths and found a sense of belonging. I learned that people cared a lot for me and started to reciprocate this love to others. I was introduced to a befriending family during my stay and treatment. They gave me a sense of security and permanence. There, I finally has a place to call home.
.
Graduating from DRTC was truly a dream come true for me as I finally had a family to go home to. I am now in my final year of school and I feel very much motivated as I finally see hope for my future.""

The uncle sexually abused me, gave me drinks and cigarettes, and kept offering me money to get what he wanted. Even when I was in pain, my uncle didn‚Äôt care. Whenever he got angry, my father scolded me for not doing anything for him ‚Äì the fact was, I did, but couldn‚Äôt tell the truth. I started self-harming, and attempted suicide.
.
I was brought to the police station after a teacher at school called my child protection officer after noticing that I was going through a crisis. My father and uncle kept calling but I was too afraid to pick up the phone. Eventually, I was warded in the hospital and sent to Dayspring for treatment.
.
I struggled for a long time trying to overcome my past. I kept blaming myself. I cut myself many times, once even on the neck in front of the other Dayspring girls. But after that cut, I realised that it simply was not worth it to keep hurting myself because it did not solve any problems. So, I stopped self-harming.
.
Now, I tell myself and others: ‚ÄòThe past is past. Now is the present. Make sure you live in the present fully and positively.‚Äô I hope that those who have gone through abuse like me can be stronger and not give up ‚Äì even though it is difficult most of the time.""

But on her 16th birthday, everything changed. Here's her story.
.
""I was only fifteen when I first attempted suicide, and I was diagnosed with clinical depression. This was after many years of immense pressure from school, hurtful words by my peers, and frequent quarrels at home. But when I told my psychiatrist about the violence at home, I was surprised by her shocked reaction. All along, I thought my father‚Äôs violence was normal and happened in other families.
.
Shortly after starting therapy, I began having flashbacks of being sexually abused by my father and more memories returned. The violence continued with my father hurling various objects at us and calling me useless for not being a boy. The next year, I started experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. I attempted another suicide; the final push to act on it came after my father touched me again.
.
On my 16th birthday, I arrived at Dayspring Residential Treatment Centre and my life has never been the same. Dayspring turned out to be a strong pillar of support, helping me through difficult times in school and with my family. Even when I experienced suicidal thoughts, the staff never gave up on me and remained understanding and patient. Being at Dayspring helped me to organise my thoughts.
.
Surprisingly, when I saw my father for the first time after entering Dayspring, I was not angry at all. I felt at peace. I realised I had forgiven him. I told him that I believed he was a good person deep down. I understood: it is through forgiveness that we free ourselves and others from the invisible shackles that once held all of us down. This was when I knew how much Dayspring had changed me.""

Read her story below to find out ‚ù§Ô∏è
.
""When I was taken away from my family to live at Dayspring, I thought I would resent this place a lot and I told myself not to trust the professionals anymore. I was someone who wasn't aware of my emotions and physical well-being. I wasn't afraid of risks and even though I knew I would have to bear the consequences of doing anything against the law, the devil in me just wanted to be a rebel. The only thing that mattered to me was being cool and having a lot of friends.
.
But as time went by, I became grateful to have the chance to stay in this wonderful place as I realised it would bring great benefits not just for myself but for my family as well. I was blessed with a befriender family that journeyed by my side and taught me the importance of honest communication in the family. Everything started to change as my family and I learned how to better communicate with each other
.
Dayspring changed me into a whole new person with new values. I used to lie a lot but now I value honesty so much. I started to be more mindful and appreciative with what I was given. I started to cherish values like change, respect and equality. I believe that these values will protect me in the future as I now know how to respond when someone wants to take advantage of me. I can now think rationally and consider the consequences of my cations.
.
I no longer believe that I am weak, neither do I feel the need to prove that I am strong by putting myself in unsafe situations. Now, I tell myself: I've been through this and I'm stronger than what I believed in""

Over the last few weeks üìÖ, my team was dabbling about what deals, promos, offers or giveaways should we be offering to ride on the wave. We know as a startup like us, we will be embarking on a suicidal track if we are to compete against the big guns with their ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù. We decided to fall back to the 1Ô∏è‚É£st reason why I decided to kickstart @givevouchersg üéÅ. My life journey had allowed me to chance upon many different walks of lives of others. The last work experience had at times left me with a fair bit of emotional drain. Seeing how certain people can treat another fellow human being so differently leaves me with a bitter taste. I then decide to embark into creating a project that is simple, yet meaningful; which is to use gifting as an angle to provide happiness to others. It is which @givevouchersg üéÅ was created. Our tagline is ‚ÄúGive A Gift, Build A Story‚Äù. We hope to create more stories of happiness as a smile on one‚Äôs üòä is priceless. 
Coming back to our 11/11 #GiftForGood campaign, It might not meant a lot to you or many of us, but this small gesture we are doing hopes to provide a smile to the faces of 100 families. We might not yet have the best deals, partners, resources on our platform for now. But I am proud that our team definitely won‚Äôt lose or even surpass what others are doing, that is we are true to our hearts to do what we have set upon. With this, I am hoping you can do a part to support our campaign, which you can help to brighten up 2 persons spirits; ie. the person who receive a digital gift & the person who will receive a meal voucher for your kind support!

IMO, going through a journey of discovery together and being there with them is the greatest form of building family ties!

It was eye opening as I came to realise how prevalent abuse cases are in Singapore. We learned on how to approach this cases and what we can do to help the victims. 
A personal important lesson I learned was that there should be no judgements on the victim's suffering. The abuse may seem mild for one party but the person who had to endure it can hurt way more than you could think. 
This course was really enlightening and I'd recommend everyone to attend this course if you get the chance. - Sembian Saravanan

Foster care offers children the opportunity to grow in a normal family environment.

There are many reasons why these children are in need of foster care ‚Äì their parents could have passed away, been incarcerated, or they could have been victims of abuse or abandonment. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

it‚Äôs so idyllic here at pasir ris park.

Having kids doesn‚Äôt mean our spirits of adventure stops. As Kate and Jake grows older, we‚Äôre able to introduce and slowly involve the kids by taking them on an adventure with us. (*much like living the cartoon ‚Äì dora the explorer) It builds their character, exposure and its really fun not just for them but for us adults as well
.
Whilst we‚Äôre still ‚Äúyoung‚Äù and able, why don‚Äôt we challenge ourselves to take on activities or hobbies out of our comfort zone, even best when its done together with family to foster bonds and create wonderful memories to look back on and laugh at. There‚Äôs never a good time to start and we‚Äôre just constantly tired. if not now, when?

Doctor said it‚Äôs nothing serious, and his lungs are clear so she asked us to just monitor and offer some paracetamol to soothe his teething.
.
This led me to thinking, kids and babies can‚Äôt really look after themselves - that‚Äôs why as parents and caregivers, we have the responsibility to take care of them and nurture them to the best we can.
.
[#sp] Motherhood is really a journey, and there‚Äôs no turning back. But for some families, when they are unable to care for their own children - agencies like @msfcares have to help the young find an alternative, a suitable family to temporarily foster and give the child a loving place to feel safe and secure.
.
The Fostering Scheme aims to provide an alternative care arrangement for children who are below 18 years of age and if you could kindly take a look at the #MSF page, (link in bio above) please try to spread the word so we can help in any way we can.

An act of care does not have to be difficult. Our recent empowerment camp together with Ngee Ann Poly saw a group of Year 1 and 2 students reaching out to the clients from Sunlove Home and Christian Outreach to the Handicapped. 
Trybe‚Äôs chosen act of kindness is the moment during the camp when we saw one of the students, whom despite facing rejection, continued to persevere, care and encourage the client to eat. We were so happy to see the duo eventually warm up to each other. We love seeing the youths‚Äô big hearts and that is why we do what we do!

Abandonment. Abuse. Family Violence. In Singapore, many children and youths are unable to remain with their parents. These children are in critical need of safe and loving foster homes to belong to.
